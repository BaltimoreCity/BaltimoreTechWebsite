  > -Steven Bugge < /p> <  p > The benefit of being a member of this meetup group
  is improving one’ s knowledge of MS Excel and learning how it can be leveraged at
  both work and home. < /p> <  p > The Excel Refresher Meetup is here  for beginning,  intermediate
  and advanced users of Excel who would like to learn and share tips and tricks with
  fellow users.Maybe you are upgrading to Excel 2007 2010 2013,  switching from PC
  to Mac or maybe your new to Excel all together.This is a great place to help get
  acquainted.Excel is an extremely dynamic and useful program and there are TONS of
  resources out there on the web  for MS Excel,  but sometimes it’ s hard to see the
  forest through the trees.Simply having someone to talk to can make all the difference
  and that is the purpose of this meet up. < /p> <  p > I was told once told by a
  manager that "MS Excel is a soft skill".Those words did not sit well with me as
  I tried to digest that statement  while thinking back to how it was my MS Excel
  skills that got me hired in the first place;at every company I had ever worked  for...
  < /p> <  p > This dichotomy eventually lead me to make the decision of working  for
  myself as a data consultant,  because what I came to realize was;it’ s not that
  MS Excel is a soft skill,  it 's that people'  s MS Excel skills are soft. < /p>
  <  p > Excel is misunderstood and therefore underutilized by many professionals.CEO’
  s,  entrepreneurs,  med students,  manufacturing analysts and venture capitalists(to
  name a few) have all reached out to me with Excel questions and are simply blown
  away by what they didn’ t know they didn’ t know.I believe that an informed community
  is a productive one.When the US produces 60,  000 engineers a year,  and India and
  China produce 400,  000 and 1.6 million respectively,  we as a nation have a lot
  of catching up to do(no pressure!). < /p> <    p > We have to begin somewhere,  of  course,  and
  I think a communal collaboration of MS Excel knowledge amongst CEO’ s,  secretaries,  professors,  students,  working
  and stay at home parents,  along with everyone in between,  is a damn good place
  to start!(#S.T.E.M.) < /p>",
