description: <p>Since I bought my first iPad in April 2010, it opened the door to
  the idea called 'Life Hack', basically imporving productivity in both in your work
  and life. I tried a local mobile device user support group for over a year and a
  half. Eventually, I was very frustrated and gave up. I realized that I should create
  my own ‘life hack for mature women’ system.&nbsp;</p> <    p > My intention is to
  share the result of what I learned and am still learning after reading 30 + books
  and over 1000 blog posts and tried over 300 apps.This is not about‘ multi - tasking’
  or mobile device overload.This is about getting more things done  while decreasing
  anxiety and stress Finally this is about being productive at any age  while keeping
  the balance in life with our peers. < /p> <  p > Let 's me explain what '  iTracking
  Party ' stands for.</p> <  p > 1. & nbsp;  'i' & nbsp;stands  for cloud and to the
  extent mobile devices. & nbsp;We will learn how to take advantage of cloud computing
  and mobile devices. & nbsp;The nut shell is to be able to access your important
  'unique'  information wherever you are. < /p> <  p > 2. & nbsp;  'Tracking',  the
  most important habit we need to creat is to track as much activity as possible.
  & nbsp;This is where moble divices become very handy. < /p> <  p > 3. & nbsp;  'Party';
  & nbsp;do you know a single biggest reason why people procasitnate ? Isolation!!,  Yes,  if
  you are normal human being,  it is almost impossible to do it alone. & nbsp;  Making
  new habits and stopping bad and old habits are so hard & nbsp;  if you do it alone.
  & nbsp;  However,  if you have someone to do it together,  &  nbsp;it becomes doable.
  < /p> <  p > This is why I  try to make 'local small groups'. & nbsp;Then within
  those groups,  we can work together. < /p> <  p > Let me know  if you want to start
  a new local group. & nbsp;I will facilitate any group which have more than 2 people.
