  game lovers with the talent and aspiration to create video games. Programmers, artists,

  fun and learn during the process. At meetups, we demo and playtest projects that
  members are working on, get feedback and ideas, discuss game design, and participate
  in short game jams. <br></p> <            p > We 're also on Slack! Please send
  a message to TonyLi, Jenny, or Tim Stowell with your email address so we can send
