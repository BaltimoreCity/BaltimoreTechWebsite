  > Hi everyone. & nbsp; < span > I ''m Alex and I''          ve been a member of
  this Baltimore Bitcoin          for a few years now.I noticed the group was without
  a community organizer and was about to be shut down unless someone filled the role.So
  I decided to          throw my hat into the ring.Most of the previous meetups were
  held at Towson Makerspace,          which has since closed,          and is no longer
  an option.So I am currently searching          for a new venue(s) to host at.I ''ve
  got some ideas but always appreciate any input any of you might have to offer. Please
  be patient during this transition. I know there hasn''          t been a meetup
  since November and I want to have our next one no later than February.But rest assured
  that we will be back in full force in the coming month. < /span></p >          <          p
