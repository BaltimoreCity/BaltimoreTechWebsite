name: Baltimore Code Craftsmanship
description: <p>Welcome to the Baltimore Software Craftsmanship User Group! This group
  is for software developers in the Baltimore,MD area that care about the quality
  of their work and want to practice and improve their programming skills, share what
  they know and learn new things from others. This is a hands-on coding user group
  with no presentations. Each meeting will be a dojo where we will go through a challenging
  software craftsmanship exercise that focuses on clean code, test-driven development,
  design patterns, and refactoring. We will pair up and practice on a kata in order
  to learn and apply the values, principles, and disciplines of software craftsmanship.
  Come with your laptop equipped with your favorite programming and automated unit
  testing environment. Be prepared to pair up, learn, share and have fun!</p> <    p
