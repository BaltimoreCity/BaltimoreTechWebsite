description: '<p>The Baltimore Node is a member-run space where people can hack, craft,
  and make interesting things in a supportive and collaborative environment. The Node
  follows the Hackerspace model that is flourishing in cities around the world, including
  New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Berlin, Sydney, and many more. Members receive
  24/7 access to the space, which is stocked with shared and donated tools and equipment.
  In addition to the informal exchange of wisdom and experience that comes from simply
  working in a shared space, the Node sponsors regular workshops and events on a broad
  range of topics. <a href=          http: //baltimorenode.org" class="linkified">http://baltimorenode.org</a></p>",'
