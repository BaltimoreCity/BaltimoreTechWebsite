name: Software Defined Networking Group - Baltimore/Washington
description: <p>This is a group created for those interested in learning about and
  discussing Software Defined Networking. I started this group because I wanted to
  foster a broader view of how SDN is changing the networking industry in the Baltimore-Washington
  corridor, and meet up with like-minded     future - casters " in the networking
  industry. The hope is that this group brings together people from many functions
  -- developers using SDN concepts in their products; network/IT architects and ops
  people deploying systems with these concepts today; and entrepreneurs who are creating
  the SDN products of tomorrow.</p>",
