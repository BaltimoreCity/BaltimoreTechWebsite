name: Cloud/DevOps Meetup @ TEKsystems
description: "<p>Welcome to Baltimore's premier DevOps and Cloud meetup hosted and
  sponsored by TEKsystems! We built this group because you demanded it. This is a
  forum for Cloud evangelists and DevOps practitioners to gather, talk about what's
  hot in the market, give presentations on cutting edge technologies, and network
  with other professionals with similar interests. We host this meetup at our office
  (999 Corporate Boulevard, Suite 200, Linthicum Heights, MD 21090) once a month from
  6:30PM-9:00PM. Soft drinks, pizza, and salad are provided.</p>"
