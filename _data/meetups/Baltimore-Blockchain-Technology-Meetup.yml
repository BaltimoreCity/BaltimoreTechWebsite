description: "<p>Blockchain is the future of technology! Blockchain decentralizes
  the data collection via a consensus mechanism, and stores this information on a
  decentralized immutable ledger. Blockchain reduces risk of security breaches and
  higher reliability. Within the new 10 years, government records, healthcare &amp;
  medical records, tax identification records will ve stored on a blockchain-based
  identity platform. <br>This group is for anyone interested in getting more knowledge
  and sharing experience on this field.</p>"
