name: Baltimore Python &Code Meetup
description: "<p>This group was created to have coding meetings aimed at beginners,
  and intermediate developers, closer to the city and on an alternate day of the week.
  This group is for anyone new to programming, or to experienced developers looking
  to share their experience and mentor newcomers. The goal is not to have this group
  tied to a specific language or technology but more for generalist interested in
  programming and technology in general.</p>"
