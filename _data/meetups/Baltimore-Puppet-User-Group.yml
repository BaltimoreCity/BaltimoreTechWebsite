description: '<p>Not to detract from the excellent <a href=  http: //www.meetup.com/Washington-D-C-Puppet-User-Group/">Puppet
  User''s Group in DC</a>, we thought that it was time that the Baltimore metro area
  was given some love.</p>    <    p > We ''re looking for administrators, developers,
  and engineers that are interested in systems automation with tools in the Puppet
  ecosystem as well as tools that can be used in conjunction with Puppet.</p> <    p
  > The only prerequisite is that you have an open mind and the willingness to both
  learn and share! < br > < br > Note: This is not a group related to traditional
  puppetry or live - show entertainment. < br > < /p>",'
