  working on the front lines of the web at any level, from beginner to expert.</p>
  <      p > There are many online resources to learn new software,    languages and
  technology.So instead,    BWDG will take a broader look at web design and development
  to help you understand what it means and where to look    for opportunities. < /p>
  <    p > Our events relate to your professional skills and personal interests.Together,    we
  can learn something new,    solve problems,    think creatively and understand how
  users interact with our work on the web.And we 'll have a little fun along the way.
