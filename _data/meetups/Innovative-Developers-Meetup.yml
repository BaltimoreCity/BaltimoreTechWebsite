description: "<p>Remember your favorite project ideas that could have made it big?
  Do you miss your college days, staying up late with friends to code the next hit
  game? It's easy to let our ideas get lost in the shuffle trying to maintain a work-life
  balance. These pet projects are more than pipe-dreams: they are central to who we
  are as people. As a group, we can encourage each other to help these ideas thrive.
  The focus of this group is to nurture innovation through collaborative discussion
  and fun challenges. We're excited to meet coders, designers, testers, and anyone
  else wanting to be involved in the development life-cycle. Come share your knowledge,
  learn about new technologies, and connect with us. My name is Dustin Bray. I'm a
  patented developer who is passionate about the creative use of technology. I look
  forward to seeing you at one of our meetings.</p>"
