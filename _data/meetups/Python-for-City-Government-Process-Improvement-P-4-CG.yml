  City Government is a group of Baltimore City employees and citizens who are passionate
  about improving local government operations.We discuss and work with Python programming
  language to help improve city workers’ daily work related to data collection,          entry,          and
  analysis,          communication,          and redundant or repetitive tasks. <
  /p> <          p > < b > Meetup Schedule: < /b></p >            <            p >
  Join us during the first Friday of every month with your laptop and Python coding
  challenges to: < /p> <            p > 1. & nbsp;Discuss and showcase Python projects
  focused on improving city government challenges or highlighting Baltimore community
  interest points < /p> <          p > 2. & nbsp;Provide a co - working space where
  participants can expand on their existing Python and data science knowledge through
  discussion,          networking,          and peer - coding < /p> <          p >
  3. & nbsp;Develop a network of Baltimoreans interested in civic technology and Python
  who can crowd - source new ideas in an open environment < /p> <          p > < b
  > Civic Technology Engagement: < /b></p >            <            p > Civic leaders,          organizations,          citizens,          and
  other stakeholders increasingly recognize the power of technology to connect people,          improve
  cities,          and make government more effective. & nbsp;We want to foster our
  and other’ s interest in this technology so that we can take advantage of innovation
  and new technology that improves government functions and citizens’ well - being.By
  creating a workspace          for individuals to learn about and hone their skills,          we
  aim to help educate a workforce that can effectively identify and solve government
  and city - wide challenges. < /p> <          p > We are a group of Baltimore City
  employees and interested people passionate about: a) making continuous improvements
  to how local government functions, b) the possibilities of Python to change the
  nature of daily work    for city workers engaged in data collection or entry,    analysis,    communication,    participation
  in paper - intense processes,    and manual or repetitive routine administrative
  tasks.Python    for City Government Process Improvement,    or "Py 4 CG",    format
  includes lightning talks and also provides a co - working space    for participants
  generating ideas on how a Python program may improve a current work problem they
  have identified.We also use the space to discuss or showcase current Python projects
  focused on improving how an aspect of city government. & nbsp; < /p>",'
