name: Baltimore Tech Parents
description: <p>A social group for helping connect busy techies, geeks and entrepreneurs
  who are also busy parents in the Baltimore area. We hope to meet every other month
  or so in an informal way to share our projects, compare notes on entrepreneurship,
  and support each other as we strive for that ever elusive   work / life balance.  "
  Babysitters encouraged, spouses welcome! (And non-parents are welcome, too -- we're
  inclusive.)</p>",
