  text-based formats, and are looking to improve their skills, particularly using
  the Vim editor, though other editor aficionados are welcome to join During our Meetups,
  we will have between 30-50 minutes of talks, with the remainder of the initial hour
  dedicated to open forum discussion, allowing users to pose questions or relate problems
  they've encountered. We will follow this with a social hour at a nearby restaurant
  for anyone who's interested!</p>"
