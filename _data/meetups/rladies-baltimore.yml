  Community Policies & Code of Conduct: < /i></p >        <        p > < i > The leadership,
  mentoring & teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority
  genders(majority gender speakers may be allowed / invited as one - off guests in
  exceptional circumstances at the leadership team ''s discretion). Due to unexpected
  demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial
  and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the
  R-Ladies communities is the development & support specifically of those identifying
  as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest
  through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved
  with R-Ladies Baltimore is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of
  this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a
  penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.</i></p> <          p
