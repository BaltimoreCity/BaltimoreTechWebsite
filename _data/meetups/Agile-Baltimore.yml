description: <p><span>Agile Baltimore is an independent organization that provides
  a structured, but agenda-less meetup. Participants gather, build an agenda, and
  begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for
  the meeting was democratically generated. People all get pads of post-it notes and
  a pen. Using a Personal Kanban, they then start to add their topics for conversation
  into the “to discuss” column. These can be literally whatever people want to discuss
  or follow a theme. Right now, we want to encourage as many unique ideas as we can.
  You don't need to be a coffee drink to participate.</span> <br></p> <            p

  a way to deliver value to the local Agile community. & nbsp; < /span> <br> </p >          <          p
