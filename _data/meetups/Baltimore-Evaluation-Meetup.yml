name: Baltimore Data and Evaluation Meetup
description: "<p>This is a group for people working at nonprofits, foundations, and
  government agencies who are interested in collecting and using data to improve their
  programs. Whether you are trying to figure out where to start, wrestling with providing
  data to funders, figuring out what outcomes you should be measuring, or analyzing
  and reporting on the data you already collect, this meetup is for you. All levels
  of expertise are welcome. Participants will discuss the issues they are facing and
  share ideas and resources in order to practically solve problems. At least one skilled
  evaluation professional will be present at every session. We are hoping to create
  a group where people from different organizations can bring questions about evaluation,
  share ideas, and build a community around data collection, outcome measurement,
  and reporting. </p>"
