description: There are over 1.5 billion biopsy slides reviewed in the United States
  each year. But with so many of them isolated on physical media or stored in localized
  drives, their value is limited to whatever on-site researchers can uncover in a
  typical workflow. We wondered what could be accomplished if clinicians could work
  more closely together on these slides, no matter the distance between them.
