name: TechThreads
location: Hampden, Baltimore, MD, United States
description: TechThreads is a recently launched web humor apparel brand based in Baltimore,
  MD. Built and managed entirely on the Shopify platform, our online catalog consists
  entirely of t-shirts at the moment, though we'll be expanding into other product
  channels across 2015, including hats, handbags, poster prints, and other accessories.
  We're also actively pursuing the build-out of site functionality to allow for user-submitted
  designs with crowdvoting capabilities.
