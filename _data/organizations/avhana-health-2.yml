description: 'Redefining Clinical Decision Support


  Avhana is redefining Clinical Decision Support (CDS). Utilizing technology and design,
  weâ€™ve built a platform that puts users at the center of everything we do.


  Integrating with the EHR, our algorithms reconcile patient specific data against
  clinical guidelines. In doing so, we can produce evidence-based recommendations
  at the point of care. Avhana simplifies the process of guideline management and
  compliance with quality programs (PQRS, MIPS, MU, etc).'
