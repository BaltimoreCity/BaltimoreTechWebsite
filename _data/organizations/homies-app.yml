description: Homies is an exciting new technology startup focused on bringing the
  roommate search in to the 21st century. With our proprietary compatibility algorithm,
  we make it possible for people to find out if theyâ€™d be compatible as roommates,
  before they ever meet the other person. We turn finding a roommate or a place to
  live from a hard, long, and uncertain search, into a fun, quick, and easy experience.
