description: There’s definitely a sense that we’re one of the good guys in the software
  development agency world. There’s a lot of ways where a company can focus on prioritizing
  getting as much money out of a client as opposed to developing a long term relationship
  with the client and I think we definitely skew on the end of focusing more on what’s
  best for the client as opposed to what’s best for the bottom line.
