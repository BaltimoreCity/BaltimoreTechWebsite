description: At The Prostate Seed Institute, we work directly with patients and their
  families to determine which treatment option is right for them. Our goal is to help
  men understand what it means to have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and to
  empower them to explore all of their treatment options. Our main mission is to guide
  a patient on a path that leads to the best possible results in every single case,
  taking into account the circumstances that are particular to the patient.
