description: We’re shaping the future of education with big ideas that challenge conventional
  thinking and advance new models of learning.  Every day we’re inspiring people to
  find new ways to learn, connect and drive change in the way education is delivered
  and experienced. Through technology and services we bring people closer to the knowledge
  they seek and to ways they can change their own education and the world for the
  better.
