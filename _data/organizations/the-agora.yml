description: Today the name “Agora” is synonymous with icons of the alternative press,
  and masters of direct marketing. The Agora, as the group is now known, is a community
  for companies that were all born of the same vision and philosophy – companies that
  celebrate the virtue of thinking independently and taking individual responsibility
  for your health, wealth, and future.
