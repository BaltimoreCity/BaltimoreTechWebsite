description: Poindexter brings something &#34;simply different to the world of tech
  support.&#34;​ With over ten years of experience, owner Lee Brandt feels that tech
  support is too corporate and impersonal. Citing Geek Squad or iYogi as prime examples,
  he argues that tech relies &#34;too heavily on massive membership, too-fast turn
  around, and impersonal resolutions that don't explain anything. People's problems
  aren't getting fixed and they're wasting money on technicians who waste time.&#34;​
