name: Poindexter Solutions
location: 703 Bunnecke Street, Baltimore, MD, United States
description: Poindexter brings something "simply different to the world of tech support."​
  With over ten years of experience, owner Lee Brandt feels that tech support is too
  corporate and impersonal. Citing Geek Squad or iYogi as prime examples, he argues
  that tech relies "too heavily on massive membership, too-fast turn around, and impersonal
  resolutions that don't explain anything. People's problems aren't getting fixed
  and they're wasting money on technicians who waste time."​
