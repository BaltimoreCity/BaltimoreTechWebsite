description: 'Galley is an early-stage startup focused on making it convenient to
  eat well on your schedule. Since our launch in January of 2015, we''ve seen rapid
  month-over-month growth and are not planning on slowing down any time soon. At Galley,
  we care deeply about the quality of everything we do - from the user experience
  in our iPhone app to the quality of the ingredients in our food.


  Ordering using the Galley app is simple, but we work very hard on thinking through
  complex operational and technology'
