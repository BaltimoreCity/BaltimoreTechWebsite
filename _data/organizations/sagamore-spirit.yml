name: Sagamore Spirit
location: 101 West Dickman Street, Baltimore, MD, United States
description: Sagamore Spirit is an authentic Maryland rye whiskey brand with its eyes
  set on a product launch in February 2016. Fueled by the great veteran distillers
  before us, we forge a new path to define American whiskey. The origin of our spirit
  is nestled beneath a 100-year old spring house at Maryland’s Sagamore Farm – uniquely
  pure and naturally filtered spring water, fed from a limestone aquifer.
