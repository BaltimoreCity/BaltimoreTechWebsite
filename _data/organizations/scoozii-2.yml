description: Travel experiences are always better when you can have a local show you
  around, but sometimes it can be very hard to find that local connection, especially
  when you don't have a lot of time to search for it. Scoozii is a platform which
  connects travelers to locals instantly through video chat on their phones so they
  can ask where to go and what to do. It's real local travel advice on demand, designed
  specifically to get explorers off the beaten path quickly, easily, and cheaply.
