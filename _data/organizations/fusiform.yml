description: 'Fusiform has created a powerful infrastructure that will allow companies
  to perform custom fabrication at scale anywhere in the world.


  We have released our software FusiformCAST, which currently connects orthopedic
  clinics and vendors in a collaborative platform to produce the best device possible.
  This software will spearhead the movement towards completely digital ordering and
  fabrication of devices, completely removing the outdated plaster hand-casting process
  and handwritten forms.'
