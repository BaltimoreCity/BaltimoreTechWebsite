  Fusiform has created a powerful infrastructure that will allow companies to perform custom fabrication at scale anywhere in the world.

  We have released our software FusiformCAST, which currently connects orthopedic clinics and vendors in a collaborative platform to produce the best device possible. This software will spearhead the movement towards completely digital ordering and fabrication of devices, completely removing the outdated plaster hand-casting process and handwritten forms.
