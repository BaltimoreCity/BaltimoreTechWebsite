  \ learn the story each shopper has about WHY they buy their favorite brands.\n\n\
  We use a variety of cameras - including placing GoPro cameras on the shelves of\
  \ stores - and conduct in-store interviews with shoppers.  Our goal is to understand\
  \ the drivers and influences that cause shoppers to pick certain brands.  \n\nOur\
  \ clients are brands and retailers eager to understand how shoppers perceive their\
  \ products in the store."
