  Give me your hardest problems to solve.

  Freelance development in the process of building a firm. I've written just about every language there is, but I prefer to do my work in Node.js because it's just plain amazing, and allows finish insane amounts of work in no time. I'm always looking for something to get in to.

  I've worked on the Under Armour site, the Michaels Crafts site, I helped build the online player for SiriusXM, I've done big analytics tools, GIS tools, and a bunch of other stuff.
