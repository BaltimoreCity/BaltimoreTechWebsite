description: Pinkaloo is on a mission to modernize charitable giving.  Current tools
  don’t match how modern donors want to manage their charitable giving. Pinkaloo’s
  software-as-a-service platform modernizes giving through our Modern Giving account,
  which is like a 401(k) or HSA for managing charitable donations. We license our
  software to Financial Institutions and Employers. The software allows donors give
  to any charity wherever and whenever they want.
