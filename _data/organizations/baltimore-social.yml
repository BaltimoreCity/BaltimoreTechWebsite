description: BALTIMORE SOCIAL operates a lot like the sports leagues of your youth.
  We bring friends and groups together to compete in a wide range of sports and activities.
  Most of our leagues are 6 to 8 weeks long with a final championship tournament and
  end of season parties. We also host one-day events and tournaments as well. From
  soccer, to Skeeball, to Sailing, BALTIMORE SOCIAL organizes the events so all you
  have to do is show up and have fun!
