description: Black Label is a collective of designers, developers, marketers, and
  other digital professionals based in Baltimore, MD. We are a worker's cooperative
  that is democratically owned and governed equally by all members. One member, one
  share, one vote. Currently we are looking for other founding members that are interested
  in helping build Black Label, and bringing tremendous value to its members and the
  community around us.
