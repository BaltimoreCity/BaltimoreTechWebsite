  MAXX Potential has developed a unique apprenticeship program, which selectively
  identifies candidates and then provides coaching and on the job training in technical
  areas where there is an unmet demand. Using proprietary assessment and training
  techniques, we identify the best fit for each individual, and they are able to earn
  while they learn, thus avoiding expensive debt.'
