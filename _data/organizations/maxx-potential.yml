  We're working hard at closing the IT Skills Gap.

  MAXX Potential has developed a unique apprenticeship program, which selectively identifies candidates and then provides coaching and on the job training in technical areas where there is an unmet demand. Using proprietary assessment and training techniques, we identify the best fit for each individual, and they are able to earn while they learn, thus avoiding expensive debt.
