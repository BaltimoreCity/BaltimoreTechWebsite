description: We're a small, passionate team of experienced game development veterans,
  proudly located just north of Baltimore, MD, who are excited about the rise of touchscreen
  platforms.  In April of 2015, we launched our first game, DomiNations. In DomiNations,
  players begin as the leader of a tribe in the Stone Age, and must guide their civilization
  through all of human history.
