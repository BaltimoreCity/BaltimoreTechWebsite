  experience for the majority of the people. It becomes trickier when you have to
  import it from off shores. That is why we the Prime Autos Japan ensures that this
  once in a lifetime experience of yours becomes memorable on the positive side instead
  of the negative one so you can enjoy the perfect ride of your finest Japanese used
  cars in Timor Lester or in any other part of the world.
