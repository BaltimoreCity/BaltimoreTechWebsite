  vegetables that would normally go to waste for cosmetic or logistical reasons -
  from farms and wholesalers. We then triage, hand-package, and deliver these fruits
  and vegetables in variety boxes to customers''â€‹ homes at a discounted rate. We offer
  mixed, organic, all-fruit, and all-veggie options.

  need through our innovative Produce in a SNAP progr'
