  thrive on the Dark Web. Join us in April to learn how big data and data science
  is being used to shine a light on the Internet''s underground activity of crime
  and trade.</p> <p>Agenda<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>6:30

  <p>Talks<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Using Big Data
  to Fight Credit Card Fraud… And Other Crimes!<br/>Fraud and identity theft are shaping
  up to become the most rampant crimes in the world, fueled by a robust online trade
  in stolen information. This underground market, commonly known as the dark web,
  enables fraud at levels never before seen in the global economy, from identity theft
  to credit card fraud to tax fraud to retail fraud, and on and on, simply due to
  the sheer volume of exploitable information for sale on these anonymized digital
  marketplaces.</p> <p>And the story doesn’t stop there. That volume of fraud goes
  on to subsidize all kinds of more violent, pernicious crime, from terrorism to human
  trafficking to gang activity to organized crime to election meddling and even the
  rogue North Korean nuclear program. But not all is lost. We can use this same scale
  of data for sale on the internet to combat the problem as well, by employing clever
  intelligence analytics that take advantage of the scale in order to chill the increasingly
  hot market for stolen information.</p> <p>In this talk, I’ll take you on a tour
  of this part of the internet in more detail, describe some of the examples of how
  these crimes are interlinked, and show examples of how large-scale data collection
  and analytics can combat it.</p> <p>Speakers<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Danny
