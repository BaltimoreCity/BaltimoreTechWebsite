description: "<p>Socializing, networking &amp; getting to know your peers is always
  part of the successful professional development process! Moreover, this can be fun
  and fairly relaxed in its format. On theses nights whenever possible, we aim to
  change up the scene and offer either an ‘inside’ or ‘outside’ social format.</p>
  <p>For outside Social nights, we’ll venture out together as a whole to a casual
  venue within the neighborhood for food and drinks and just no-pressure enjoyment.
  Tip: if you’ve ever been meaning to get business cards for yourself, do so by these
  nights as this is a great time to pass these out to new people with whom you connect.
  You never know just whom you may come across both within or apart from our group.
  With that said, please keep in mind that while outside social nights are meant to
  be very relaxed and casual; we’re all representing Baltimore Black Techs (each other)
  as well as our individual selves and will keep all interactions with everyone in
  good taste.</p> <p>On Inside nights, We encourage you to bring your gaming laptops,
  board &amp; table games, nerdy passions, side hobbies, board games etc. We’ll aim
  to provide group games, drinks, pizza and other snacks!</p> "
how_to_find_us: Please note that there is NO FREE PARKING at the lot adjacent to Impact
  Hub (10 E North Avenue). Attendees are advised to use nearby street parking, and
  NOT the lot next to IH as this has caused some visitors to have their cars impounded
  in the past.
