description: '<p>Join us for one hour of distraction free writing! We’ve discovered
  that it’s strikingly helpful to write with other writers. See if it’s true for you
  at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, April 22, 2019.</p> <p>Be it a book, blog, script, essay,
  dissertation, resume, melody, poem or just plain work stuff, you are invited to
  write it with us. No one will see what you''ve written or give you unsolicited advice.
  Instead of just thinking about writing, come and get some real writing done.</p>
  <p>SCHEDULE:<br/>6:30 - SESSION 1: quick intros.<br/>6:45 - timer starts: write
  for 1 hour.<br/>7:45 - (the end) chat / take off / keep writing. the library closes
  at 8 p.m.</p> <p>OPTIONAL SOCIALIZING may happen in the future depending how these
  first few meetings go. Writing is very solitary. Connecting (and sometimes even
  commiserating) with other writers is a cool thing.</p> <p>BEING LATE IS OKAY: just
  show up and get settled, then check-in with me after the session. (I’m one of the
  librarians on duty that evening.) If you were on time, please be willing to make
  room for the friendly latecomer.<br/>Happy writing and I look forward to seeing
  you at the Light Street Branch!</p> <p>What Should I Bring?<br/>Whatever you need
  to be able to write!<br/>Bring earbuds/earplugs if you want to block the the occasional
  conversation by other patrons.</p> <p>Other Important Details:<br/>The library has
  WiFi: EPFL - no password.<br/>TRAVEL / PARKING: Street parking available for a fee.
  Some street parking is free with a few block walk to the library.<br/>GUIDELINES:
  Drink are welcome in the library with a lid - no food.</p> '
