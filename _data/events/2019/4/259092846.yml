  Media - Look On Media’s advanced VR utility training is built from the ground up
  to effectively teach and track trainees learning dangerous and critical tasks such
  as identifying gas leaks in the field. The interactive VR software is modeled after
  real world scenarios and randomized each time to reinforce the critical thinking
  necessary to complete the tasks effectively. Under the hood it is measuring numerous
  data points and providing scores and feedback to the trainee after each user session.
  The powerful software is already in use at major utility providers and can be customized
  for any use case, even for industries outside the utility space such as healthcare,
  education and industrial training.</p> <p>Digital History Studios - Digital History
  Studios will be displaying a variety of projects, but most notably, the Berlin Wall
  Experience for the Vive which was produced for the Newseum in DC. Viewers are brought
  back in time to the Berlin Wall in the mid 1980’s and can explore various places
  in both West and East Berlin. There are a variety of interactive elements such as
  operating a searchlight on top of an observation tower, finding a hidden tunnel
  to escape to the West and taking a sledgehammer to crack the Wall.</p> <p>Callen
  Shaw Indie Games - VR Party Club is a party game for Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Windows
  Mixed Reality. Their goal is to build an easy learning VR game where 1-4 players
  can throw, roll, shoot and slice their way to 1st place, in various board game and
  mini game environments! VR Party Club was designed for comfortable, intuitive game
  play to delight both VR veterans and neophytes. With one-button controls and zero-nausea
  design, VR Party Club would like to become the first true "killer app" for VR.</p>
