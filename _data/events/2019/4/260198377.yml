description: '<p>Let''s celebrate the end of the 2018 tax season with good food, strong
  drinks and most importantly...great company. Everyone seemed to like the Mount Vernon
  Marketplace at the last meetup, so we''re taking it back there for a second time:
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mountvernonmarketplace/" class="linkified">https://www.instagram.com/mountvernonmarketplace/</a></p>
  <p>And again we''re listing the time as 5:30p-7:30p but a group of us ended up staying
  longer last time, having great discussions about crypto, government, banking and
  the future...so there''s a good chance we''ll go later this time too.</p> <p>Want
  to help make this community stronger? We''re always looking for more people to help
  put these meetups together. Ideally we''d like to have both city and county meetups
  and have more educational events. If you''d like to help, please contact Alex or
  Sam or bring your ideas to this next meetup.</p> <p>See you there!</p> '
