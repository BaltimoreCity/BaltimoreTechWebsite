description: '<p>The city of Daggermark is best known for its poisoners and assassins,
  who maintain active guilds that enjoy the full respect of local authorities. Local
  venture-captain Istivil Bosk prefers to keep his head down and stays out of their
  affairs, but he has recently learned that a Pathfinder agent has been targeted for
  assassination. Can the PCs enact the venture-captain''s daring plot to save this
  agent without becoming the assassins'' next victims?</p> <p>Written by Nicholas
