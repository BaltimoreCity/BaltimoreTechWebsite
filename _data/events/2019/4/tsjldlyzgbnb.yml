description: '<p>The monthly <a href="https://calug.org">CALUG</a> meetings generally
  have a volunteer speaker who gives a presentation generally lasting 45-60 minutes.
  This length of presentation allows for Q&amp;A time from those in attendance. The
  members are a friendly group and we welcome topic on Linux, IT security, and related
  fields of interest to the group.</p> <p>When there is not a presenter we hold an
  open discussion meeting for members to talk about any topic which comes up.</p>
  <p>Our meetings are held at the offices of the <a href="https://www.umbctraining.com/Home">UMBC
  Training Center</a> in Columbia, MD. From 6:30-7:00pm we enjoy some social time
  over pizza and soda sponsored by our friends at <a href="https://aplura.com">Aplura</a>!
  The presentations start about 7pm and last until they are done. The meetings generally
  wind up about 9pm.</p> <p>If you are presenting at a Con, to your office, want to
  practice your public speaking, or just want to present on a topic that you are learning
  about please feel free to contact us. If you would like to give a presentation please
  contact Chuck Frain to arrange a meeting to present at.</p> '
