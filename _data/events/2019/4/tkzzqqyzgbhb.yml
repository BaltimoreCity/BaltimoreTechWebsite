description: '<p>Format</p> <p>Each python meet up will: 1) start with a short flash
  talk demoing a project, library of useful feature or function—the ‘talks’ section,
  2) have participants working individually on a short program around data analysis
  or automation of a task—the ‘development’ section, 3) use GitHub to provide access
  to the code base or data required for the meet up, 4) have roaming meet up coaches
  on hand to help answer questions or provide assistance on the ‘development’ portion
  of the meet up, and, 5) 1—2 groups will demo their solution, findings or key observations
  to close out the meet up.</p> <p>Goals</p> <p>The meet up has 3 goals:</p> <p>1.
  Serve as a foundation for the creation of a Python eco-system in City government.</p>
  <p>2. Encourage and empower municipal employees to identify opportunities to ask
  and answer more complex questions and eliminate repetitive, paper-intensive, non-value
  added work.</p> <p>3. Automate key parts of the data analysis and reporting workflow
  to help the management decision making process to improve service delivery.</p>
  <p>What to Bring</p> <p>Bring your laptop. For those of you who forget to bring
  a laptop, we will provide a limited number of computers for you to use.</p> <p>Meet
