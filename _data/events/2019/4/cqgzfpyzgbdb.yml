description: '<p>Finally do something with all those family photos, vacation shots
  or video clips on your phone. At our April meeting we will review techniques and
  tools used to make a Photo Essay. Basically a Photo Essay is a customized slideshow
  consisting of a collection of images, background music and compelling transitions
  to entertain family/friends, document a trip, or tell a life story. Expert slideshow
  artist and photographer, Dick Russell, will be at the meeting to share the process
  he uses when creating a Photo Essay as well as demo software used to produce amazing
  shows.</p> <p>The assignment topic: TBD. Deadline for submission is March 3,[masked]:59PM.
