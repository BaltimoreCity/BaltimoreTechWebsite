description: "<p>HI THERE! We will meet in the Mosaic Conference Room (Front) HCLS
  Central Branch, 10375 Little Patuxent Pkwy Columbia MD 21044. Please RSVP, so we
  can get accurate count.</p> <p>TOPIC: Effective IT Asset Inventory with Splunk</p>
  <p>I'll review how you can produce a correlated inventory of your IT systems to
  improve your existing inventory tracking efforts/CMDB.<br/>I'll dive into using
  DBX &amp; SA-LdapSearch, but the techniques are generic enough to be helpful in
  most Enterprise environments.<br/>I'll also share some tips learned along the way
  to make the process easier.<br/>Finally I'll discuss what other opportunities Splunk
  provides for improving on traditional inventory management techniques.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> "
