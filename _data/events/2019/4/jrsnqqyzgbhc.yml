description: "<p>We will be doing things just a little differently today! It's Speaker
  Night but we will be having a Career Path Panel Discussion. This is going to be
  an interactive discussion with some professionals in the industry who can provide
  insights and share their stories of how they got into the tech industry. This is
  a great opportunity for you to ask questions if you are still thinking about how
  to advance in your career or begin to pursue your interest in the tech industry.
  Hope to see you there! Thank you:fist::skin-tone-6:</p> <p>On speaker &amp; presenter
  night, we will feature either guest speakers or our very own members who want to
  present on a particular topic as a host. Presentations may consist solely of just
  pure instruction/dictation but can also involve hands-on activity to engage the
  group as a whole as well. They should last anywhere from a minimum of fifteen minutes
  to a maximum of the duration of our entire group session and are relevant to the
  tech industry. If you would like to host a session on a topic of your choice or
  invite a guest speaker for a talk please plan accordingly by getting in touch with
  the organizers ahead of scheduled nights to be added to this roster. Topics include
  but are not necessarily limited to:</p> <p>- Specific instructional topics in programming,
  software, or hardware.<br/>- Careers &amp; opportunities.<br/>- Specific organizations,
  their mission(s) &amp; structure.<br/>- Relevant social issues.<br/>- Building a
  business or startup.<br/>- New ideas<br/>- Personal experiences &amp; motivational
  advice related to careers in the tech industry.</p> "
how_to_find_us: Please note that there is NO FREE PARKING at the lot adjacent to Impact
  Hub (10 E North Avenue). Attendees are advised to use nearby street parking, and
  NOT the lot next to IH as this has caused some visitors to have their cars impounded
  in the past.
