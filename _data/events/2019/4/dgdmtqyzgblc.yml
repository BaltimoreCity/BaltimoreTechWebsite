  <p>This is a collaborative learning meetup. Our main focus is studying a deep learning
  framework called FastAI. It is a revolutionary deep learning framework that can
  train a model with far fewer lines of code than Keras.</p> <p>We do not have an
  instructor for the course. Most of the lessons are self-paced. We encourage everyone
  to learn together in a respectful and collaborative manner.</p> <p>Google Drive:<br/><a

  <p>Things we ask of you:<br/>* Come with an enthusiasm to learn. We are all students
  here.<br/>* Be willing to share your insights and discoveries and help one another.<br/>*
  Come with the willingness to problem solve.<br/>* You don''t need to establish yourself
  as subject expert from the jump.<br/>* Be willing to make mistakes and ask dumb
  questions.<br/>* Better to have a moment of injured pride than a lifetime carrying
  ignorance.<br/>* Space is limited to 15 for most of our meetup dates. Please update
  your RSVP accordingly and we hope to see you at the next meetup!<br/>* Come excited
  to learn everything about machine learning and Fast AI</p> '
