description: "<p>We're changing it up a bit this month! DevOpsDays Baltimore is April
  24th and 25th, so with the attendees and speakers in town Baltimore DevOps has been
  asked to provide a social event for our visitors as well as our stalwart meetup
  members. As such, we're doing a DevOps Trivia Night on the eve of the DevOpsDays
  Baltimore conference.</p> <p>We will form teams at the start of the meet-up. Team
  sizes will be based off of the number of attendees. We'll do 3 rounds of 8 questions
  each and trivia questions will be from the following categories:</p> <p>DevOps Tools<br/>Baltimore
  Lore<br/>Computing History<br/>Tech in Pop Culture</p> <p>Please note that we are
  not meeting at our usual day of the week or time this month. If trivia isn't your
  thing, we'll be back to our regularly scheduled meetup format in May.</p> <p>Join
  the conversation on the Baltimore Tech Slack: #devops</p> "
