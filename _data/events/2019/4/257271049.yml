description: '<p>In these compelling Holocaust memoirs, Nanette Blitz Konig relates
  her amazing story of survival during the Second World War when she, together with
  her family and millions of other Jews, was imprisoned by the Nazis with a minimum
  chance of survival. Nanette was a classmate of Anne Frank in the Jewish Lyceum of
  Amsterdam. They met again in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp shortly before
  Anne died. During these emotional encounters, Anne Frank revealed how she and her
  family hid in the annex , their deportation, her experiences and her diary. Nanette
  describes her battle for survival under brutal conditions in the camp and what happened
  to her after the war. This memoir continues with her struggles to recover after
  the war from the effects of starvation and tuberculosis and how she was able to
  rebuild a life for herself.</p> '
