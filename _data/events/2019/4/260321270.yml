description: "<p>Buying anything on credit is always a bit scary. This goes double
  when you’re attempting to manage technical debt. The interest that can build on
  technical debt is variable at best and can really sink your team or company goals
  when advancing a platform, an application, or launching a new product alongside
  existing products.</p> <p>How do you stop your company or coding efforts from going
  broke with technical debt? Through this interactive talk, we’ll share some techniques
  used from the Kanban Method to support ongoing and healthy technical debt management
  that involves all the necessary players from management, product ownership, scrum
  master or delivery manager, developers, and testers.</p> <p>- Learn how to address
  technical debt by managing for it from the top down.</p> <p>- Gain knowledge on
  how to express technical debt in business language terms.</p> <p>- Develop your
  awareness to quantify the cost of technical debt in business terms, not just as
  a potential risk.</p> <p>Our speaker, Joey Spooner, is an Accredited Kanban Trainer
  and Kanban Coaching Professional at TriTech Enterprise Systems, Inc. In an 18-year
  career spanning the communications, insurance, higher education, non-profit, and
  government sectors, Joey has been a software developer, IT director, strategic analyst,
  and technical expert. He blogs at www.spoonstein.com and tweets as @spoonstein.
  Joey holds a Bachelors in Business Administration.</p> <p>We will meet at TEKsystems
  in Linthicum. There is plenty of free parking in front of the building. Doors will
  open at 6:30 PM for pizza and conversation, and the presentation will start at 7:00
  PM. If you get there after 7:00 and find yourself locked out, you will find our
  phone number posted on the front door. Call the number and someone will come to
  let you in. Don't be embarrassed - happens all the time.</p> <p>Many thanks to our
  sponsor, TEKsystems, for hosting this meeting and providing pizza!</p> "
