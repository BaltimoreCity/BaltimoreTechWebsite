  <p>Join professional photographers Loren Fisher and Ron Lake as we welcome spring
  and go on a special urban landscape photographic exploration of five of New York’s
  magnificent bridges.</p> <p>It will be a day packed full of fun photo opportunities
  at little known locations Loren and Ron have discovered and also at some popular
  spots. You will transported all day in Loren’s 12 passenger Sprinter van, so you
  don’t need to worry about how to get around. You’ll be taken to the closest possible
  drop off for each location but there will still be plenty of walking involved.</p>
  <p>Our photography will start at the George Washington Bridge at the little known
  Little Red Lighthouse, which sits right under the bridge. The lighthouse was there
  10 years before completion of the bridge and is one of the smaller lighthouses you’ll
  see at only 40’ tall. Getting there is a bit of a hike but our van will drop you
  off as close as possible. The area is now a park, although this is a place you might
  not want to go alone, especially at night.</p> <p>We’ll hop back in the van and
  go to the other side of Manhattan to the Queensborough Bridge, which is one of the
  more striking big bridges with its tan paint that captures the light in unique ways
  depending on the angle you view it. You’ll be taken to a couple of hidden spots
  that offer special views of the bridge that most people don’t see.</p> <p>From there
  we are off to the Williamsburg Bridge and a lovely park on the Manhattan side. This
  bridge is a bit more industrial and there are some great places to make graphic
  shots. We’ll walk under the bridge and get shots of the piers in the water. The
  tall columns holding up the roadway leading to the bridge are next to tall residential
  buildings which make for interesting images.</p> <p>Now we are on to Brooklyn where
  we’ll go to a spot where you can photograph the Empire State Building framed by
  one of the Manhattan Bridge towers. It is a fun shot and you have to know the exact
  spot to be to get the shot. While in DUMBO (Down Under Manhattan Bridge Overpass)
  we’ll get great shots of the Manhattan Bridge, which was the world’s longest bridge
  when it was finished in 1909, beating out the Brooklyn Bridge by four feet. There
  are lots of great angles to shoot it from and you can even get the Brooklyn Bridge
  and lower Manhattan’s tall buildings in the background.</p> <p>The van will then
  take you over to the stairs leading to the Brooklyn Bridge and we’ll walk up on
  it for great shots of the bridge, Manhattan and surrounding area. That will put
  us right up on the pedestrian area of the bridge. You do need to watch for bicycles
  if you walk in the bike lane, you’ll get yelled at and clipped if you encroach in
  their space.</p> <p>By the time we come down from the bridge, the sun will be setting
  and we’ll go to a park along the Hudson River to shoot the lights of Manhattan shining
  as the sky darkens and blue hour sets in. A wide angle shot of the Brooklyn Bridge
  with a glowing Manhattan in the background is a must for every photographer! What
  a great way to end the day.</p> <p>This is a workshop for any level of photographer,
  even those who prefer shooting with an iPhone! Not only will you be transported
  to great locations, Loren and Ron will make sure you are getting the best shots
  possible and help you with any photographic needs.</p> <p>There are three places
  where you can join the tour: the Bridgewater, NJ, train station, Penn Station in
  New York or Grand Central Terminal. Pickups are at 10:30 a.m. in Bridgewater, 12:00
  p.m. at NYC Penn Station or 12:30 p.m. at Grand Central. Exact locations will be
  sent after you register.</p> <p>You will be transported to the great locations so
  there won’t be a tremendous amount of walking, but you still will need to walk two
  or three blocks in some locations.</p> <p>For more info and to register go to <a
