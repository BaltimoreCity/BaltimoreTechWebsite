  ~ 2:30<br/>1. Discuss results from class survey<br/>2. Discuss how to structure
  class and learning objectives<br/>3. Discuss new medium of communications</p> <p>2:30
  ~ 5:00<br/>Individual study time. (If you have questions or run into lesson issues
  during the study time, please send your questions to our Slack channel.)</p> <p>_____________________<br/>Important
  info for new members joining our meetups for the first time:</p> <p>Please fill
  out the Google form, we will send you an email with all the instructions on joining
  group and to begin learning.</p> <p><a href="https://forms.gle/c99gpkZWXNBj3nv89"
  class="linkified">https://forms.gle/c99gpkZWXNBj3nv89</a></p> <p>This is a collaborative
  learning meetup. Our main focus is studying a deep learning framework called FastAI.
  It is a revolutionary deep learning framework that can train a model with far fewer
  lines of code than Keras.</p> <p>We do not have an instructor for the course. Most
  of the lessons are self-paced. We encourage everyone to learn together in a respectful
  and collaborative manner.</p> <p>Google Drive:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1clG3cSr0_HB8zd9lXmRxvy9WWwecd_Ze"

  <p>Things we ask of you:<br/>* Come with an enthusiasm to learn. We are all students
  here.<br/>* Be willing to share your insights and discoveries and help one another.<br/>*
  Come with the willingness to problem solve.<br/>* You don''t need to establish yourself
  as subject expert from the jump.<br/>* Be willing to make mistakes and ask dumb
  questions.<br/>* Better to have a moment of injured pride than a lifetime carrying
  ignorance.<br/>* Space is limited to 15 for most of our meetup dates. Please update
  your RSVP accordingly and we hope to see you at the next meetup!<br/>* Come excited
  to learn everything about machine learning and Fast AI!</p> '
