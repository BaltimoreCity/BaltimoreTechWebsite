  experience. Also, guest appearance by Flip Searles with ITC program. You won''t
  want to miss this.<br/>Gettysburg Ghost Exchange Is much more than just a Paranormal
  Equipment store. It is a dream come true and an extension of our home, so The Deadly
  Grounds Coffee will always be on, conversation and laughter fills our rooms and
  friendships will be made to last a lifetime! We are the place where the Paranormal
  Field Gathers to share evidence and purchase the BEST equipment that the field has
  to offer! We also have a Healing Room and a beautiful Crystals and Fossils display!<br/><a

  <p>Pam and Steve love all things paranormal. They are also paranormal investigators
  who enjoy helping people and love what they do. Along with Events and Ghost Tours,
  they have the latest and coolest equipment in the industry. If they don''t have
  it they can get it!</p> <p>Flip Searles has been investigating the paranormal for
  several years, and has worked alongside the top names in the field. His main area
  of focus is Instrumental Trans-Communication. He was a co-founder of the Generic
  Black Shirt Group, which was chronicled on the television show “Paranormal AfterParty”.</p> '
