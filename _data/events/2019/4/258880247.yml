description: '<p>Come experience the gift of breath and its inherent capacity to awaken
  and calm.</p> <p>We will allow our breathing to be our compass and our manna as
  we experience four specific guided practices to heighten and heal.</p> <p>We will
  engage in the Sufi practice of elemental breaths to balance our energy and the Yogic
  practice of opposite nostril breathing to balance our brains. We will be invited
  into a mindfulness practice of breathing to help us handle strong emotions like
  fear and anger as well as generate inner joy and happiness. We will end with a simple
  breath awareness practice, learning how to inhale vitality and energy and exhaling
  fatigue and tension.</p> <p>We have a recommended offering of $5. Doors open at
  6:45 pm, and we begin promptly at 7:15 pm.</p> <p>Nancey Kinlin is a Registered
  Nurse with a focus on radical well-being. She honors many teachers who have contributed
  to her rich experience of energy medicine, dance and meditation. Her privilege is
  to share this work with others.<br/>#meditation #mindful #breathing #Indiginal #MeditationMonday</p> '
