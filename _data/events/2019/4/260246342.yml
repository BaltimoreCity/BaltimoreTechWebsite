description: '<p>Our April meetup (cross-posted with the Maryland AI meetup, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Maryland-AI/events/260146181/"
  class="linkified">https://www.meetup.com/Maryland-AI/events/260146181/</a>) features
  a presentation, Toward Human-Centered Machine Learning, by Patrick Hall of H2O.ai.
  Doors open at 6 pm. After a half-hour of networking and refreshments, our program
  starts at 6:30 pm.</p> <p>Patrick''s presentation illustrates how to combine innovations
  from several sub-disciplines of machine learning research to train understandable,
  observationally fair, trustable, and accurate predictive modeling systems. Techniques
  from research into fair models, directly interpretable Bayesian or constrained machine
  learning models, and post-hoc explanations can be used to train transparent, observationally
  fair, and accurate models. Additional techniques from fairness research can be used
  to check for disparate impact in model predictions and to preprocess data and post-process
  predictions to ensure the demographic parity of predictive models. Finally, new
  testing and debugging techniques can increase the trustworthiness of model predictions
  on unseen data. These techniques create a new and truly human-centered type of machine
  learning suitable for use in business- and life-critical decision support.</p> <p>Patrick
  Hall is senior director for data science products at H2O.ai where he focuses mainly
  on model interpretability. Patrick is also an adjunct professor in the Department
  of Decision Sciences at George Washington University, where he teaches graduate
  classes in data mining and machine learning.</p> '
