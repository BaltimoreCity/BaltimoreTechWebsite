description: "<p>If you've been to our events lately, you've seen how a little data
  science or machine learning can help advance important issues. Take this opportunity
  to start building your own skill set.</p> <p>This interactive training will introduce
  legal and other non-tech professionals how to code in a programming language called
  Python. You will learn the basics of computer programming, the limitations of what
  software can do, and how to start writing your own programs. Python can be used
  to make web scrapers, Twitter bots, and document automators.</p> <p>Bring your Laptop!</p>
  <p>This is an interactive training where every attendee will be writing code, so
  bring a laptop to the event. This course is designed for beginners with no coding
  experience. The class will be taught by Matthew Stubenberg, an attorney and computer
  programmer who has developed numerous, successful legal technology projects.</p> "
