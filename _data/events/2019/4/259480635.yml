description: "<p>Join us at the Howard County Columbia Branch Library to discuss game
  development, talk shop, and work on your games! Anyone with an interest in game
  design and development is welcome, from beginners to veteran professionals.</p>
  <p>If you're working on a game, you're welcome to show it and have people playtest
  it to offer feedback. There should be plenty of time to get down to business and
  work on our own projects, too.</p> <p>Reminder: This meetup is at the Columbia Branch
  in the Mosaic Room.</p> "
