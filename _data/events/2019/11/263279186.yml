  welcome to attend R-Ladies events?<br/>A: Yes, men are welcome at this event. Our
  mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in
  the R community. However, we ask that cis men come as guests of women and gender
  minorities to our events to promote a sense support and encouragement for women
  and gender minorities in the R community. Please help us by spreading the word about
  R-Ladies. Please also take the time to review our code of conduct before you attend:

  as female (trans and cis), trans-men, non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,
  intersex, and all minority genders).</p> <p>Important to know:<br/>- If this is
