description: "<p>Moving to serverless makes some things better and some things worse,
  but pretty much nothing stays the same. The threats to your serverless apps are
  consistent in many ways, but they may not look and act the same way. While serverless
  reduces some of the top security threats, vulnerabilities within the application
  layer remain. Additionally, some security threats become even worse and entirely
  new challenges arise.</p> <p>Maintaining control and security requires a paradigm
  shift in your thinking.</p> <p>In this presentation, Tsion will cover the security
  advantages of serverless application architectures. Next, he’ll examine the top
  6 serverless security challenges, along with solutions for mitigation, many of which
  can be implemented immediately.</p> <p>1) How to deal with the loss of the perimeter<br/>2)
  2 Steps to managing permissions in serverless<br/>3) Tackling the risks of vulnerable
  application dependencies<br/>4) New tactics to battle the persistent problem of
  bad code<br/>5) Mitigating denial-of-service, or the new serverless challenge ‘denial-of-wallet’<br/>6)
  Reduce risks from container reuse (don’t be fooled by the ephemeral promise)</p>
  <p>SpeakerBio:</p> <p>Prior to co-founding Protego, Tsion served as Chief Strategy
  Officer for Gemalto’s Identity and Data Protection Division, where he was responsible
  for developing global business and product strategies, and identifying and capitalizing
  on emerging market trends within the information security market. Prior to assuming
  his role as Chief Strategy Officer, he oversaw SafeNet’s (acquired by Gemalto in
  2014) Data Protection product portfolio strategy and execution. Tsion joined the
  company in April 2009 from Aladdin Knowledge Systems, where he led the company’s
  global sales and marketing efforts. Prior to that role, he led Aladdin’s Content
  Security business unit.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>• 6:30pm - Food &amp; networking</p>
