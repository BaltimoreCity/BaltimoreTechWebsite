  to drive to Ohioipyle for a 11:00 rafting time, you can grab a bite to eat in the
  town before the trip</p> <p>There will be guides on the trip, but not in every raft</p>
  <p>For those who have never been before, the town is inside a state park and is
  absolutely amazing. The guides will take us to the river at noon and we will spend
  about 4-5 hours rafting including a stop for lunch on the river. After the trip
  we will stop at a local pizza place for dinner, you''ll be hungry, and head back
  to Baltimore. We should be back at the Park and Ride by 9:30. You do NOT need any
  prior experience to go on this trip, nor do you have to be a strong swimmer.</p>
  <p>Because we are doing this trip on a Sunday, and this is our second time going
  this season, we are getting a discount. The 55$ includes the cost of the rafting
  trip plus lunch on the river. This is a rain or shine event, and refunds will be
  given at the outfitters discretion.!</p> <p>CLICKTO PAY: <a href="https://book.laurelhighlands.com/reserve/res49443-lower-yough-guide-escor"
