  <p>Talks<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Talk: Elasticsearch
  for Business Intelligence and Application Insights<br/>Speaker: Sean Donnelly<br/>Elasticsearch
  is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing
  number of use cases. In this talk, Iâ€™ll discuss the fundamentals of storage and
  retrieval in Elasticsearch, why we decided to use it for search in our applications,
  and how you can also leverage it for both business intelligence and application
  insights.</p> <p>Talk: Machine Learning for Requirements Engineering<br/>Speaker:
  Jon Patton<br/>This project applies a number of machine learning, deep learning,
  and NLP techniques to solve challenging problems in requirements engineering.</p>
  <p>Talk: An Asynchronous Distributed Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection System
  for IoT Devices<br/>Speaker: Pu Tian<br/>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in IoT
  devices are crucial for cybersecurity. Existing models may fail due to increased
  traffic pattern complexity and data complexity. To address these challenges, we
  propose an asynchronous distributed deep learning based IDS in which only training
  weights are shared and devices of heterogeneous computing power can train asynchronously.
  Empirical results on a large network intrusion dataset show that the system achieves
  high detection accuracy.</p> <p>Talk: Fortune 500 Company Performance Analysis Using
  Social Networks<br/>Speaker: Yi-Shan Shir<br/>This presentation focus on studying
  the correlation between financial performance and social media relationship and
  behavior of Fortune 500 companies. The findings from this research can assist in
  the prediction of Fortune 500 stock performance based on a number of social network
  analysis metrics.</p> '
