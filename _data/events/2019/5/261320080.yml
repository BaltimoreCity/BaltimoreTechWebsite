description: '<p>Biometrics and our Privacy Future</p> <p>Biometrics is the measurement
  and analysis of physical or behavioral characteristics of a person, such as their
  face, fingerprint, voice, or conduct as a means of verifying identity. Biometrics-based
  applications can offer secure and user-friendly identity management and verification
  solutions. However, biometrics pose a special threat to personal privacy because
  they use characteristics intrinsic to you that can never be changed. Once a biometric
  is compromised, it can be impossible to regain anonymity from those willing to misuse
  it.</p> <p>Facial identification systems are increasingly being adopted by governments,
  big tech, and banks. In the United States the legal rules protecting individuals
  from abuse of these technologies are few and far between. However, recent legislative
  developments indicate momentum may be building for significant privacy legislation
  both at the state and national level. Come out to Legal Hackers on Wednesday 29
  May to hear biometrics policy analyst, Christopher Anastasio, and privacy attorney
  Razvan Miutescu discuss the present and future state of biometrics and privacy in
  the United States.</p> <p>Christopher Anastasio is a consultant for Ideal Innovations
  Incorporated in Arlington, VA. Chris has spent the past fifteen years working in
  the Department of Defense (DoD) biometrics field, primarily as a policy analyst,
  strategic planning consultant, and acquisition strategist, including as senior biometrics
  policy analyst at the DoD Biometrics Task Force. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopheranastasio/"
