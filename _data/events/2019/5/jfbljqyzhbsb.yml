description: '<p>Join us for another round of Ruby, Rails, and more! On the agenda
  this month:</p> <p>* You?</p> <p>Got something that you''d like to present? We still
  have room for another short talk or two. Contact the organizers and let us know.
  We especially love first time presenters and new perspectives! Even if you have
  never presented anywhere before, we''d love to hear from you :)</p> <p>Talks are
  generally no longer than 20-30 minutes (we can make exceptions if you need to rehearse
  for a conference). Lightning talks (&lt;5 minutes) and shorter talks are also welcome.</p>
  <p>Seriously, let us know if you''re at all interested!</p> <p>B''more on Rails
  is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone. Our
  Anti-Harassment Policy (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/pages/B%27more_on_Rails_Anti-Harassment_Policy"
  class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/pages/B%27more_on_Rails_Anti-Harassment_Policy</a>).</p> '
how_to_find_us: It's on the second floor - don't go in the food court/bar area, walk
  around to the south side (AWAY from the Pizza Boli's and police station) stairwell.
