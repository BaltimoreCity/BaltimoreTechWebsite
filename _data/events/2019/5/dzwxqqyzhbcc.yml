description: '<p>What is an atheist? Anyone who does not have a significant belief
  in the existence of any gods. This meetup group includes and welcomes atheists,
  agnostics, freethinkers, secularists, humanists, skeptics, rationalists, or any
  other assorted label. That includes those who disagree with us -- but expect a lively
  argument! We are a friendly group and love to meet new attendees.</p> <p>So come
  and join us for conversations on various topics: atheism, agnosticism, secularism,
  skepticism, science, politics, human rights, the environment, the culture and media,
  entertainment, books, sci-fi, food, and anything else you can think of.</p> <p>This
  is a casual social gathering to meet people and chat. There is no agenda. If you
  have ideas on how to promote atheism and such in this town, or want to work on that
  project, by all means let us know.</p> <p>This meeting occurs on the 3rd Tuesday
  of every month. We also have meet ups in other locations, for those not able to
  travel into the city. Check our full schedule for more information.</p> '
