  Feeser, MPH (National Association of City and County Health Officials)</p> <p>Equity
  is a central pillar to many health, education and livelihood programs; yet, as a
  multifaceted concept, it can be considered difficult to evaluate. Many programs
  often face challenges in measuring the impact of initiatives to reduce inequities
  (rooted in economic, race, and/or gender differences). Others seek to prioritize
  service delivery to where it is most needed but struggle to determine whether they
  are reaching their intended population. During this event, panelists will spark
  discussion around the importance and philosophy of, and recommendations for and
  approaches to, equity measurement.</p> <p>Light refreshments will be available,
  and there will be time at the beginning and end of the event for networking.</p>
