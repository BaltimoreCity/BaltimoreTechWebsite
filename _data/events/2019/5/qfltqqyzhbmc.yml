description: '<p>The theme for Wednesday night will be "Prepare for Summer!"</p> <p>What
  does that mean? At some point this summer the weather will be bad, or it will just
  be crazy hot and humid outside. What will you do to make the best of your time indoors?
  How about some Elixir!</p> <p>Our goals for this event are:<br/>1. Answer any questions
  someone getting started with Elixir might have<br/>2. Ensure everyone has Elixir
  running on their laptop<br/>3. Look at open source projects or learning efforts
  you can undertake this summer<br/>4. Get help on any side projects you might be
  working on<br/>5. Network!</p> <p>====</p> <p>We rely on the community to keep this
  meetup going. Please consider suggesting a topic or activity, or even better, volunteer
  to speak!</p> <p>If you have an idea for a talk you''d like to give, please send
  a message to one of the organizers and we''ll make it happen!</p> <p>====</p> <p>We
  are dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone. Please
  see our Code of Conduct (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Elixir-and-Erlang-Meetup/pages/28313285/Code_of_Conduct/"
