description: '<p>OK, take two! February''s meetup didn''t happen, and it was disheartening!
  But have no fear, there are many months left in 2019.</p> <p>Per usual meetup procedure,
  we''ll have our meeting gather at the VLP for presentation(s), and afterwards anyone
  who still wants to hang out can continue on to nearby food venues (location TBD).</p>
  <p>----</p> <p>Scheduled Talk(s):</p> <p>* Vim Regular Expressions - Daniel Weber</p>
  <p>-----</p> <p>Scheduled Beer: Brewer''s Art "Resurrection", a 7% Belgian Dubbel.
  Via The Beer Advocate: "During the fermentation of the first batch of this Abbey-style
  dubbel, the yeast ''died'' and was ''resurrected'' by brewer Chris Cashell. Made
  with five types of barley malt and lots of sugar, this beer is quite strong and
  flavorful, without being too sweet."</p> '
how_to_find_us: As usual, we will be in the office building across the street from
  the main VLP library building, on the second floor. The inside door will be locked,
  but someone will be listening for the knock.
