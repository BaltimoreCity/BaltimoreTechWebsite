description: '<p>For the 1st 30-45 minutes, we''ll be having a group discussion about
  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and how non-profits in our community are addressing
  it strategically and tactically. This round table is a follow up to the webinar
  on SEO that was provided on May 9th by Zac Heisey. Here are some questions we will
  use to start the conversation:</p> <p>1. Are your websites responsive/fast and mobile
  friendly?<br/>2. How are you building content partnerships?<br/>3. What are you
  doing to get social mentions?<br/>4. How do you promote content? What was your process
  for determining<br/>keywords/content (including any tools you used, like a keyword
  recommender)?<br/>5. How have you successfully gotten mentioned in any news providers
  or community associations?<br/>6. If you have done paid placements, how did you
  determine the return on investment?</p> <p>If you weren''t able to attend the webinar
  or need a refresher, a recording can be found here: <a href="https://bit.ly/2V9FptJ"
  class="linkified">https://bit.ly/2V9FptJ</a></p> <p>The 2nd half of the meeting
  will be small group breakouts helping nonprofits with any technology needs, which
  could include: auditing website to identify improvement opportunities, fixing bugs/issues,
  small enhancements like page additions, content tweaks, integrating plug-ins and/or
  social media, etc.</p> <p>Nonprofits - It is very important that you come prepared
  with an idea of what you need help with flushed out as best you can! Also, bring
  your computer and any log-in information for your website so Tech Volunteers have
  access.</p> <p>Food (likely pizza) and drinks will be provided!</p> '
how_to_find_us: We'll be in the very back of Betamore, in the open room with the projector.
