description: "<p>Thursday, May 2nd, 2019 at Asymmetrik</p> <p>5:00-5:15PM Mingle with
  pizza and refreshments<br/>5:15-7:15PM Presentation/questions (continue pizza/refreshments)</p>
  <p>Presenter: Markus Dale</p> <p>Apache Spark is a popular big data framework and
  after our Scala intro for Spark in January, we are ready to dive into the Spark
  compute model and its API for data engineering. Learn about:</p> <p>* Spark ecosystem
  and libraries<br/>* RDDs<br/>* driver/executors<br/>* partitions<br/>* lazy evaluation
  - transformations vs. actions<br/>* shuffle<br/>* Dataset API<br/>* Read, manipulate,
  store...</p> <p>This presentation will mix concepts with code and we will send out
  links to the repository, setup etc. a couple of days before the actual presentation
  if you want to follow along on your own laptop.</p> <p>Presenter relevant bio:<br/>Markus
  is the organizer of the Baltimore Scala meetup and a senior software developer at
  Asymmetrik where he gets to work with some of his favorite languages, frameworks
  and infrastructure like Scala, Akka, Spark, Elasticsearch and AWS. Before joining
  Asymmetrik he was a solutions architect for Databricks where he also taught Apache
  Spark classes using Scala. Before Apache Spark he created and taught an Apache Hadoop
  class for UMBC Training. After some LISP and Scheme in grad school and a mostly
  object-oriented Java-centric software developer career, it was Martin Odersky's
  Functional Programming Principles in Scala MOOC that got him hooked on Scala and
  a more functional approach to software.</p> <p>Note on address: Make sure you turn
  on Sentinel Drive, *not* Sentinel Way (don't turn at the light). Ample parking in
  front of the building or in the adjacent parking garage. Take elevators or stairs
  (it will be early in the year so New Year's resolutions should still be in effect)
  to 4th floor. Use Asymmetrik main entrance (not employee entrance) - ring bell if
  not open.</p> "
