description: '<p>Generating ideas (concepts, solutions, features - anything) can be
  fun and exciting and give you a lot of potential options. Great, right? Not if you
  lack a clear plan for next steps and down select. At the end of the day, the ideas
  you have are only of value if you have ways to critique and prioritize them for
  further development or actions. This session will cover methods you can use to capture
  feedback and react to ideas in an actionable way. Additionally, we''ll cover methods
  for organizing those ideas and helping prioritize next steps. These methods work
  great for groups but can also be done solo as needed. Additionally, they require
  very little set-up and very few materials - meaning once you understand them you
  can almost immediately find ways to apply them to your work (or even personal life!).</p>
