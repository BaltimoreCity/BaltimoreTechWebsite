description: '<p>Use brain science to build better products -- no psychology PhD required!</p>
  <p>Companies spend enormous amounts of time and money designing the experience for
  products and services. But in truth, “the” user experience isn’t a singular experience
  at all. And it doesn’t happen on any screen – it happens in the mind. More specifically,
  the six minds.</p> <p>Our speaker, John Whalen, is author of the just-released book
  "Design for How People Think: Using Brain Science to Build Better Products". He
  will describe how to uncover the conscious and subconscious needs of your users
  using qualitative research techniques, and how to integrate what you’ve discovered
  into your product and service designs.</p> <p>John Whalen, PhD, leads Brilliant
  Experience, a DC-based UX consultancy known for transforming psychological user
  insights into powerful business strategy and advanced UX innovations. He has a Masters
  and PhD in Cognitive Science (Johns Hopkins University), has completed a Post Doctoral
  Fellowship at UCLA, and was a Psychology Professor at the University of Delaware
  before launching his company.</p> <p>As Partner, Psychological Insights &amp; Innovation
  at Brilliant, John’s specialty is providing businesses with competitive advantages
  by uncovering the spoken and unspoken needs of users through user research, and,
  from those insights, producing powerful, actionable business and experience strategies.
  His expert knowledge of human vision, attention and memory is relied on by Fortune
  500 companies including Google, PayPal, Capital One, and Bloomberg.</p> <p>We will
  meet at TEKsystems in Linthicum. There is plenty of free parking in front of the
  building. Doors will open at 6:30 PM for pizza and conversation, and the presentation
  will start at 7:00 PM. If you get there after 7:00 and find yourself locked out,
  you will find our phone number posted on the front door. Call the number and someone
  will come to let you in. Don''t be embarrassed - happens all the time.</p> <p>Many
  thanks to our sponsor, TEKsystems, for hosting this meeting and providing pizza!</p> '
