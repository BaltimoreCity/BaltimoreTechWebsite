description: "<p>Our next formal CharmBUG meeting will be held at Onyx Point in Hanover,
  MD. The goal for this meeting will be to discuss any BUG topics, or general issues,
  followed by an informal discussion and hacking session about Reverse Engineering
  with BSD.</p> <p>The goal for this informal discussion and hacking session will
  be to cover all of the various tools available to BSD operating systems for reverse
  engineering, including the extracting of data from EEPROMs offline with FreeBSD,
  and some additional hardware hacking topics. Additional tools for reverse engineering
  will be looked at and hacked on, including radare and Ghidra, the open sourced reverse
  engineering tool from the NSA which has been submitted as a port for FreeBSD.</p>
