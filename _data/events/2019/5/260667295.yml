description: "<p>HI THERE! We will meet in the Warfield Meeting Room HCLS Central
  Branch, 10375 Little Patuxent Pkwy Columbia MD 21044. Please RSVP, so we can get
  accurate count.</p> <p>We will be welcoming Chuck Frain who will be talking about
  Organization with Org mode.</p> <p>So you’ve been spending some time Marie Kondo-ing
  your life since the new<br/>year. One of the things you’ve discovered doesn’t spark
  joy in your digital<br/>life organizer tools. Emacs Org mode may be what you’re
  looking for.</p> <p>Org mode started in 2003 as an outlining tool with enhancements
  for taking<br/>notes and TODO lists. As things go with such projects it has grown
  and<br/>features are added over time. Some of the additional features enhance<br/>project
  planning, authoring documents, task tracking and more utilizing the<br/>power of
  Emacs Lisp. Org mode can help you consolidate many of your various<br/>tracking
  tools. All in a plain text format.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> "
