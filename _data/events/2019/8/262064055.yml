description: '<p>Come connect with one another this year at R. House, make friends
  and learn about local tech at this year''s Super Meetup!</p> <p>The Super Meetup

  about the participating meetups and chat with the organizers one-<br/>on-one to
  find out more ways to get involved.<br/>• Grab free beverages and chow down on some
  pay-as-you-go food at<br/>local food trucks<br/>• Bring plenty of business cards
  and lots of energy! We will even have field<br/>games such as cornhole.<br/>• Find
  opportunities with the exhibiting sponsors (and grab some sweet<br/>swag)</p> <p>HANG
