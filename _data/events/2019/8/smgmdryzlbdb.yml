description: '<p>Join us to hear City of Baltimore DGS''s Python Specialist, Ana Basoco,
  talk about how she uses Python, PythonAnywhere, and Twitter to create a fully-automated
  Twitterbot that sends out data-driven messages to shout-out accomplishments or agency
  reports snippets! She''ll talk through PythonAnywhere''s capabilities, how she used
  this to remove the human element in running the Twitterbot continuously, and how
  she worked through challenges in data-connectivity to send out the Python-calculated
  metrics.</p> <p>Ana will build on her presentation from last year''s Python Meetup,
  and comes to DGS through the Code for the City program. More information here:</p>

  <p>---</p> <p>Goals</p> <p>The meet up has 3 goals:</p> <p>1. Serve as a foundation
  for the creation of a Python eco-system in City government.</p> <p>2. Encourage
  and empower municipal employees to identify opportunities to ask and answer more
  complex questions and eliminate repetitive, labor or paper-intensive, non-value
  added work.</p> <p>3. Help participants think through and pursue the use of Python
  as a tool to automate key parts of the data analysis, reporting or administrative
  task workflow to help the management decision making process or improve service
  delivery.</p> <p>What to Bring</p> <p>A laptop and some curiosity.</p> <p>Meet Up
