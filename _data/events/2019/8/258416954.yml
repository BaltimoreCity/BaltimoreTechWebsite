description: "<p>Are you interested in 3D Printing, has it ever piqued your interest?
  Join us today as John Fitzell of University of Maryland's Terrapin Lab presents
  an introductory lesson on 3D Printing and Design.</p> <p>You will learn :<br/>How
  to prepare models for 3D printing,<br/>How to set up models in the slicer software,
  and<br/>How each different printer technologies work.</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>On
  speaker &amp; presenter night, we will feature either guest speakers or our very
  own members who want to present on a particular topic as a host. Presentations may
  consist solely of just pure instruction/dictation but can also involve hands-on
  activity to engage the group as a whole as well. They should last anywhere from
  a minimum of fifteen minutes to a maximum of the duration of our entire group session
  and are relevant to the tech industry. If you would like to host a session on a
  topic of your choice or invite a guest speaker for a talk please plan accordingly
  by getting in touch with the organizers ahead of scheduled nights to be added to
  this roster. Topics include but are not necessarily limited to:</p> <p>- Specific
  instructional topics in programming, software, or hardware.<br/>- Careers &amp;
  opportunities.<br/>- Specific organizations, their mission(s) &amp; structure.<br/>-
  Relevant social issues.<br/>- Building a business or startup.<br/>- New ideas<br/>-
  Personal experiences &amp; motivational advice related to careers in the tech industry.</p> "
how_to_find_us: Please note that there is NO FREE PARKING at the lot adjacent to Impact
  Hub (10 E North Avenue). Attendees are advised to use nearby street parking, and
  NOT the lot next to IH as this has caused some visitors to have their cars impounded
  in the past.
