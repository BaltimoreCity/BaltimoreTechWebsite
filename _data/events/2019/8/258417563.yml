description: "<p>Can you believe it?! Baltimore Black Techies Turns 2!</p> <p>Join
  us as we celebrate 2 years in the making of our meetup which began in July 2017!
  We've had members from different geographical areas, industry, race/ethnic group,
  age group et al.</p> <p>The common denominator is that we have a sense of community.
  We have been able to connect with and learn from the brightest minds in the Baltimore
  area and beyond in the past year. Some techno-curious minds and those interested
  in connecting with other tech professionals have graced us with their presence.</p>
  <p>We have been blessed with a community of consistent members, supporters, partners,
  and sponsors who we are happy to have grown with. It does take a village! We appreciate
  you and hope you can make time to celebrate with our community.</p> <p>Here s a
  brief agenda :<br/>5:00 PM - Tour of Great Blacks in Wax Museum. This will be a
  1-hour tour, if you are interested, you must RSVP. We need a headcount to provide
  ahead of time.<br/>6:00 PM - Fruit Cocktails,<br/>6:30 PM - Dinner, A Look Back
  In Time, Why We Exist<br/>8:00 PM - Bust a Move! We'll end the night with a Soul
  Train freestyle - show off your fave Baltimore Dance Moves.</p> <p>Please send any
  questions to [masked]</p> "
