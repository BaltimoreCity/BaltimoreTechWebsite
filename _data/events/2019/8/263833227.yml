  - feel free to bring something fun for Mammoth to smash! We'll have pizza and soft
  drinks free of charge, feel free to BYOB.</p> <p>This is a family friendly event,
  so feel free to bring the kids!</p> <p>The two hour episode starts at 8:00pm and
  continues till 10:00pm. We may smash a few more items afterwards in celebration
