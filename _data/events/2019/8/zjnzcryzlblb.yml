description: "<p>Join the conversation on the Baltimore Tech Slack: #devops</p> <p>For
  the August event, we will be joining the annual Super Meetup!</p> <p>Details<br/>Come
  connect with one another, make friends and learn about local tech at this year's
  Super Meetup! The Super Meetup is a gathering of the most-connected members of the
  local tech, startup, and<br/>entrepreneurial scene. It’s a chance to make new friends
  and learn more about local tech and entrepreneurial resources and tech-focused meetup
  groups.</p> <p>The idea of the Super Meetup is simple: meetups are integral to any
  tech scene. Every now and then, it makes sense to rally the leaders of tech-related
  meetups in town and gather for one big mixer. The idea is to connect people with
  groups they may not have otherwise known about.<br/>Be sure to grab some food and
  drinks and hang with your favorite Meetups.</p> <p>What to expect:<br/>• Learn about
  the participating meetups and chat with the organizers oneon-one to find out more
  ways to get involved.<br/>• Grab free beverages and snacks!<br/>• Bring plenty of
  business cards and lots of energy! There will be a number<br/>of people you will
  want to network with.<br/>• Find opportunities with the exhibiting sponsors (and
  grab some sweet<br/>swag)</p> <p>When and where:<br/>Thursday, August 8, 2019<br/>6:00
  PM to 9:00 PM<br/>R. House Baltimore - 301 W 29th St · Baltimore, MD<br/>#SuperMeetup2019</p> "
