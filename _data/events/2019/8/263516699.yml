  World Civic Data &amp; Analytics in Baltimore City Government<br/>Does Baltimore
  City government even know how to use data? Why is [insert service here] still paper-based?

  <p>Smart cities, civic data use, and urban data analytics are all hot topics, but
  what are the current capabilities and applications in our own city government? Justin
