  <p>----</p> <p>Scheduled Talk(s):</p> <p>• Vim Startup (Beginner) - Stephen Belcher,
  15 Minutes</p> <p>If you''ve never played with Vim''s startup flags, I don''t blame
  you; the coolest stuff happens after you''re inside Vim. But, there are some interesting
  ways Vim can be interacted with from the command line, and I''ll explore a few of
  those in this talk.</p> <p>• Anything you''d like to talk about? Check out <a href="http://baltimorevim.org/submit-a-talk.html#form"
