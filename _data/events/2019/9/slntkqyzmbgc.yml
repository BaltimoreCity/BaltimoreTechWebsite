description: '<p>Come prepared with an idea or two for some open source code that
  you''d like to hack on, be it a brand new gem, a new feature in an old gem, or just
  some bug fixing. Bring your laptop and be prepared to hack or help someone else
  out with their idea.</p> <p>We''ll break into pairs, or larger groups, or whatever
  seems natural - and we''ll see how much we can accomplish in two to three hours.
  There is no minimum skill level - hacking with other people is a great way to learn,
  so if you don''t have any open source ambitions of your own, or you are still new
  to coding, that''s okay! Come to help others, and come to learn. Feel free to bounce
  around ideas in "Talk about this Meetup" below!</p> <p>Dinner is provided, usually
  pizza &amp; soda. BYOB.</p> '
how_to_find_us: Enter the doors on the left side of the building (just past the restaurant
  entrance), head up to the second floor, then about 2/3 of the way down the hall
  on your right.
