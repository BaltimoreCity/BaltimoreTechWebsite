description: "<p><b>What is Open Hack night?</b></p> <p>The Baltimore Hackerspace
  Open Hack night is an opportunity. It's an opportunity to show off your newest idea,
  creation, or prototype, meet people with similar or different skill sets, and an
  opportunity to have a peer review or brainstorming session done on your idea. It's
  a great way to get your feet wet in the hackerspace that's right around the corner.
  Everyone is welcome to come, seek advice, stay, collaborate, and contribute -- think
  of it as a scheduled time when everyone meets to help out everyone else. The Baltimore
  Hackerspace is an open-space, meaning members come and go, work on projects, and
  collaborate with other members as they please.</p> "
