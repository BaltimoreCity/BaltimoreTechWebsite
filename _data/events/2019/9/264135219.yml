description: '<p>Greetings GDG Baltimore! Our September even kicks off a series of
  workshops for Flutter. The series will be led by me, Reuben Turner (GroovinChip).
  Throughout the series we will be learning Flutter by getting our hands dirty with
  real, practical code. We will do things like tackling outstanding issues on the
  Flutter repo, and building real apps. We will start by learning how to install Flutter
  and analyzing the default Counter app. We will also have a Q&amp;A session where
  I will answer Flutter questions. We will also have pizza and drinks!</p> <p>Please
  join our Slack group at <a href="https://gdgbaltimore-slackin.herokuapp.com/" class="linkified">https://gdgbaltimore-slackin.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
  <p>Please follow us on Twitter at @GSGBaltimoreNew</p> <p>You can also email [masked]</p>
  <p>I look forward too seeing you all there!</p> <p>- Reuben</p> '
how_to_find_us: Suite 300. The elevator is keyed, so please message us on Slack when
  you arrive so we can come get you and bring you upstairs.
