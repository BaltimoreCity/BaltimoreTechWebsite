description: '<p>Format</p> <p>Each python meet up will: 1) start with a short flash
  talk demoing an idea, project, library of useful feature or function—the ‘talks’
  section, 2) allow opportunities for folks to work individually on a short program
  around a Python use case like data analysis or automation of a task—the ‘development’
  section.</p> <p>Goals</p> <p>The meet up has 3 goals:</p> <p>1. Serve as a foundation
  for the creation of a Python eco-system in City government.</p> <p>2. Encourage
  and empower municipal employees to identify opportunities to ask and answer more
  complex questions and eliminate repetitive, labor or paper-intensive, non-value
  added work.</p> <p>3. Help participants think through and pursue the use of Python
  as a tool to automate key parts of the data analysis, reporting or administrative
  task workflow to help the management decision making process or improve service
  delivery.</p> <p>What to Bring</p> <p>A laptop and some curiosity.</p> <p>Meet Up
