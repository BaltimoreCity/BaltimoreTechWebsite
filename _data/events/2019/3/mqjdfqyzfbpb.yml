description: '<p>Come one, come all! The Games &amp; Stuff Monday night Adventure
  Card Game group is planning to embark on the next epic season of adventure card
  gaming with the Season of Tapestry''s Tides! Experience a new adventure with us
  as we band together with fellow Pathfinders to reclaim what we can from Hao Jinâ€™s
  demiplane before it collapses!</p> <p>A few notes about PACG Organized Play:</p>
  <p>1. To participate in Organized Play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder
  Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the cards
  needed to play a single character class in Organized Play, as one of the three to
  four PC options per class.</p> <p>2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we
  are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can probably make
  more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.</p> <p>3. You
  can find the official guide to organized play here: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy98no?Guide-to-Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Ca"
  class="linkified">http://paizo.com/products/btpy98no?Guide-to-Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Ca</a>
  rd-Guild-Organized-Play</p> <p>The store copy of the game will be focusing on Season
  of Tapestry''s Tide. The scenarios for Season of the Shackles, Season of the Righteous,
  Season of the Runelords, Season of the Goblins, Season of the Plundered Tombs, and
  Season of the Faction''s Favor Adventures are available at the store and can be
  run by anyone with a copy of the core card game (the store has a copy of everything
  except Runelords, which is also needed for Goblins) and the relevant Adventure Deck
  numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can
  expand the number of player seats.</p> '
