description: '<p>In this meditation you will learn Kabbalah practices that bring positive
  and powerful changes in to your life when you add them to your spiritual practice.
  With some of the practices the body is engaged with the words shared that allow
  for spiritual alignment. Come join us as Sybastien guides us through Ecstatic Kabbalah.</p>
  <p>For centuries humanity has been seeking Oneness. From the Tower of Babel to today
  we''ve reached towards God in many ways hopeful to be heard. We believe, for fear
  that we are alone in space. Through this session you will gain confidence and develop
  a mindset of peace likened to the Psalmist who says, "He who planted the ear, shall
  He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see?" (Psalm 94). The only answer
  is to trust and know He/She is OmniPresent, OmniPotent, OmniScient and All Love!
  Making a joyful noise we will explore Ecstatic Kabbalistic concepts as we Proactively
  unite in the 99% of sharing instead of the 1% of Reactivity. We will raise our voices
  to enhance our connection to El Elyon thereby bringing peace to Self and our community.<br/>We
  have a recommended offering of $5. Doors open at 6:45 pm, and we begin promptly
  at 7:15 pm.</p> '
