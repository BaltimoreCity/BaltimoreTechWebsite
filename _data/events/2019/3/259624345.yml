description: "<p>The speaker will present IoT development comparison of Raspbian to
  Windows 10 Core operating systems and their development tools. The use of several
  different sensors will be presented.<br/>We will compare two operating systems for
  the Raspberry Pi hardware. Raspbian which is a Linux variant and Windows 10 Core
  which Microsoftâ€™s offering for IoT. We will investigate the installation and boot.<br/>There
  are different development tools available for the Raspberry Pi on the two operating
  systems. This includes the Visual Studio and Eclipse integrated development environments
  (IDE). The .NET framework and other GPIO (General Purpose I/O) libraries will be
  demonstrated.<br/>A gyroscope will be used to modify the tempo of a song. Also,
  magnetic sampling will be demonstrated to create a 3D compass. The code to drive
  these devices will be shown written in C#, C++ &amp; Python programming languages.<br/>We
  will utilize the clean room in the back. The speaker will project the Raspberry
  PI and the slides.</p> "
