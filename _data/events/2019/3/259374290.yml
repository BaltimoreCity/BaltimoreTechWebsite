description: '<p>Building applications using domain-driven design techniques results
  in code that is easier to modify, maintain, and test, and a better user experience.
  Once you try DDD, you will never think about designing software in the same way
  again.</p> <p>In this introduction we will start by learning how to build a strong
  ubiquitous language with stakeholders. Then we will learn the benefits of encapsulating
  business logic in value objects using test-driven development.</p> <p>Next we will
  move on to using bounded contexts, entities, and aggregate roots to manage state
  and protect invariants.</p> <p>Our speaker, Andrew Cassell, is a Senior Backend
  Developer for CuriosityStream, the award-winning documentary streaming service launched
  by Discovery founder John Hendricks. He is also the organizer of the DCPHP Meetup
  and a frequent conference speaker.</p> <p>We will meet at TEKsystems in Linthicum.
  There is plenty of free parking in front of the building. Doors will open at 6:30
  PM for pizza and conversation, and the presentation will start at 7:00 PM. If you
  get there after 7:00 and find yourself locked out, you will find our phone number
  posted on the front door. Call the number and someone will come to let you in. Don''t
  be embarrassed - happens all the time.</p> <p>Many thanks to our sponsor, TEKsystems,
  for hosting this meeting and providing pizza!</p> '
