description: '<p>BonJour Tous! What is Tarot, the card game? NO we are not going to
  read your cards, tea leaves or palm, and quite frankly my Crystal Ball has been
  cracked for a while now. But we are going to play French Tarot. A card game that
  is trick based and includes bidding. The deck holds 76 cards and they are all distributed
  before the start of each round. Small hands bring your UNO card holder! The game
  is played with 3, 4 or 5 players. I currently have two decks so the limit on this
  will be 10. If you are responder 11 or 12 come! we will teach more. As we get larger
  I will separate players into beginners and intermediate. We will be teaching and
  playing open hands till people feel comfortable. Teaching is in English...okay maybe
  Franglish. Once we move to closed hands looking for more French speaking.</p> '
