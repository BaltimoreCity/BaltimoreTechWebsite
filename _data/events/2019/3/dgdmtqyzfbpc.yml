  <p>To gain access to Google Drive so you can do more than just view the documents,
  add your contact information to the contact info page link posted above and then
  send me a message so that I can add you to the drive!</p> <p>IF you can''t find
  us, send a message to Jonathan S (event Organizer) to coordinate how to find us
  at the library.</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>1:30-2pm Meet and greet<br/>2pm-5pm Work on
  Lesson</p> <p>Description:<br/>The purpose of these weekly "classes" is so that
  we can all work at our own pace on the lesson, but offer help to one another if
  someone hits a roadblock. You must come with the willingness to problem solve--I''m
  not going to be lecturing, just going to be learning just like everyone else.</p>
  <p>If you have an interesting thought, start talking about it with the group! This
  should be a no-pressure situation, you don''t need to establish yourself as subject
  expert from the jump. Just focus on learning, be willing make mistakes and ask dumb
  questions. Better to have a moment of injured pride than a lifetime carrying ignorance.</p>
  <p>Logistical Notes:<br/>I will insist that within the time where we''re focusing
  on the actual lesson (2-5pm)--let''s all limit our socializing to concentrate on
  the work.</p> <p>I''ve limited the class to the first 15, so if you can''t make
  it, please don''t hold up the spot for someone who can. If you can''t physically
  attend a meeting, just do the work from home! There''s a google drive with notes
  and questions/thoughts that we had, so if you need access to the drive, please PM
  me so I can invite you.</p> <p>Excited to see you guys and learn!</p> '
