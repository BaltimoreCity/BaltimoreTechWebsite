description: "<p>Docker, and likewise Linux containers, have taken the development
  industry by storm. Legacy applications are being re-packaged as micro-services to
  break away from the heavy application installs and complex dependencies. Although
  lots of developers already use Docker on their machines for application testing,
  it's not always clear how Docker applications should be configured for a production
  web hosting environment.</p> <p>I'm Dan Healy, founder and systems engineer for
  Healy Technologies. I've accomplished an electrical engineering degree from Old
  Dominion University as well as a master's of IT and Systems Engineer from University
  of Maryland University College. My experience includes technical leadership with
  the Johns Hopkins University enterprise web hosting team and architecting a Docker-based
  web hosting replacement for student and faculty websites. I also serve as a Senior
  Systems Engineer for Clever Devices LTD where I provide senior leadership and direction
  for multi-million dollar public transit technology projects.</p> <p>In this demo,
  I'll teach you how to create a 3-node HA Docker Swarm cluster with a shared storage,
  container registry, and a reverse proxy. We'll also discuss some best practices
  for logs collection.</p> <p>Extra Details:<br/>Our office building may require assistance
  for wheelchair accessibility. Please use the telephone number on the door if you
  have access issues or have arrived late. Restrooms and on-site parking are available.
  Alcoholic beverages are available for attendees over 21.</p> "
