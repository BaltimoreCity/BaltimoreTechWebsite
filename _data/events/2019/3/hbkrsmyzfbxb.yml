description: '<p>Welcome!</p> <p>Each Monday, we will be meeting for Chess Club at
  the Barnes &amp; Noble on the Johns Hopkins University campaus (3330 St. Paul St)
  from 6pm to 9pm. Typically, our members meet around the Starbucks coffeeshop inside
  the B&amp;N store. As always, please be considerate and remember to patronize the
  coffeeshop that they offer.</p> <p>This is a relatively new chess club, so your
  feedback is always encouraged. In the meantime, please feel free to join our Facebook
  group and trade some chess-related hints, books, and videos.</p> <p>Link: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/814679158643847/"
