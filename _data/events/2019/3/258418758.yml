description: "<p>\U0001F340 Ever been curious about 3D printing? Try your luck this
  Thursday before St. Patrick's day discovering the basics of computer-aided design,
  3-dimensional modeling and 3D printing with easy to follow tutorials &amp; simple
  guided exercises!</p> <p>\U0001F340Before you arrive: You will need to have a CAD
  software ready to use on your system this Thursday evening. Some of these are indeed
  Browser based. Please take a look at the website link below. This site features
  a list of 30 different FREE CAD software programs for all levels of users.</p> <p><a

  <p>For beginners I recommend starting with TinkerCAD (Browser based) or 3D Builder,
  for intermediate and advanced users, Fusion360 and Blender have gotten good reviews.</p>
  <p>Descriptions of each software in included with them in this website as well as
  the download links.</p> <p>\U0001F340What to Bring:<br/>• Laptop with either Windows,
  Mac OS or Linux operating systems.<br/>• A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software
  installed/ready to use<br/>• Curiosity</p> <p>Please note that a while 3D printer
  will be present during this Thursday night's session; it may not be available for
  everyone to utilize, given the time that it takes to print a single object (time
  constraints). If you have a file you wish to print please email Hunter in advance
  ([masked]) or message him in Slack regarding some arrangements which can be made.</p>
  <p>Please stand by soon for announcements regarding near-future workshops for more
  3D-Printing.</p> <p>\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340\U0001F340<br/>More
  About Project Night:</p> <p>Welcome to Project night! On project nights we’ll dive
  head-first into the projects with which we’re directly involved &amp;/or most interested.
  If you’re still brand new to coding &amp; project development and unsure how to
  directly contribute to an active project, that’s perfectly fine. Participate as
  an observer and take notes; by doing so you will only learn &amp; grow! Project
  leads &amp; more seasoned developers in our group are encouraged to help our beginners
  learn, feel engaged and get their toes wet in whatever aspects of projects they
  feel most comfortable. More than one project workshops may be going on at once during
  these nights and ideas for new projects are always welcome. Some of our projects
  in the works and those already suggested are not limited to but also include:</p>
  <p>• Web design &amp; Front-end development<br/>• Chatbots<br/>• Raspberry Pi configuration<br/>•
  Arduino configuration<br/>• Google APIs in practice<br/>• Hardware &amp; Robotics</p>
