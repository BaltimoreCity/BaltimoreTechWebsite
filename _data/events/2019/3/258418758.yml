  About Project Night:</p> <p>Welcome to Project night! On project nights we’ll dive
  head-first into the projects with which we’re directly involved &amp;/or most interested.
  If you’re still brand new to coding &amp; project development and unsure how to
  directly contribute to an active project, that’s perfectly fine. Participate as
  an observer and take notes; by doing so you will only learn &amp; grow! Project
  leads &amp; more seasoned developers in our group are encouraged to help our beginners
  learn, feel engaged and get their toes wet in whatever aspects of projects they
  feel most comfortable. More than one project workshops may be going on at once during
  these nights and ideas for new projects are always welcome. Some of our projects
  in the works and those already suggested are not limited to but also include:</p>
  <p>• Web design &amp; Front-end development<br/>• Chatbots<br/>• Raspberry Pi configuration<br/>•
  Arduino configuration<br/>• Google APIs in practice<br/>• Hardware &amp; Robotics</p>
