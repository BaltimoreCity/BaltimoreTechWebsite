description: '<p><b>What is Open Hack night?</b></p> <p>The Baltimore Hackerspace
  Open Hack night is an opportunity. It''s an opportunity to show off your newest
  idea, creation, or prototype, meet people with similar or different skill sets,
  and an opportunity to have a peer review or brainstorming session done on your idea.
  It''s a great way to get your feet wet in the hackerspace that''s right around the
  corner. Everyone is welcome to come, seek advice, stay, collaborate, and contribute
  -- think of it as a scheduled time when everyone meets to help out everyone else.
  The Baltimore Hackerspace is an open-space, meaning members come and go, work on
  projects, and collaborate with other members as they please.</p> '
