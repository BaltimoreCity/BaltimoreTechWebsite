description: '<p>This is a writer''s meeting. The primary purpose of this meeting
  is to help people develop their writing skills. That can and does cover anyone from
  just a person with a strong desire to write and no idea where to start all the way
  up to a writer who has a working script that needs to be polished.</p> <p>By the
  way if you do have a script you want us to read aloud then you need to bring a least
  a half dozen copies of that script or send me a PDF of your script ahead of time
  so I can print them off. Printing is no problem just get your script to me early.</p> '
