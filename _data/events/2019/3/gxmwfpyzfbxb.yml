description: '<p>R. House is a big specialty food court on Remington Avenue right
  off 28th Street, Remington, Baltimore. There are lots of tables that we could put
  together. There is Asian food, vegetarian food, Venezuelan arepas, special chicken,
  a ''pop up'' chef that changes all the time, a huge bar, and a coffee vendor. It
  is a place for new chefs to show off their talents.</p> <p>There is parking at a
  garage which can be entered from 27th or 28th street. Your ticket will be validated
  at R. House for parking. There is also parking on both sides of R. House and one
  half of the police station parking lot on the corner is reserved for R. House customers.</p>
  <p>We will be at a big table near the sushi vendor. This is on the right side when
  you enter. There will be a French flag showing at our table.</p> '
