description: "<p>Two years ago was the massive adoption of serverless technologies,
  and currently it’s not showing any signs of slowing down. And it’s growing 2.5x
  faster than container adaption.</p> <p>On this wave, our company decided to take
  the advantage of this emerging technology. And our story is on how we were able
  to move our monolithic application to make use of AWS Lambda and other related services.
  This story will give you an idea on how we manage the rewrite and it will also reflect
  the benefits and challenges we encountered.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Ethan have been
  an architect and principal engineer with a variety of industries ranging from financial
  research to Advertising. Since early 2017 Ethan have also worked extensively with
  AWS Lambda in production.</p> <p>We need to change the presenter and the topic in
  the last minute, sorry about that. Johnny got production issues, at work and it's
  all hands on deck for the next few days for him. But we got you covered with Ethan.
  See you all in the meetup.</p> "
