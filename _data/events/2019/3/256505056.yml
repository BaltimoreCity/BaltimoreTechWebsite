description: '<p>What would it really mean to live forever?</p> <p>Rachel is a woman
  with a problem: she can’t die. Her recent troubles―widowhood, a failing business,
  an unemployed middle-aged son―are only the latest in a litany spanning dozens of
  countries, scores of marriages, and hundreds of children. In the 2,000 years since
  she made a spiritual bargain to save the life of her first son back in Roman-occupied
  Jerusalem, she’s tried everything to free herself, and only one other person in
  the world understands: a man she once loved passionately, who has been stalking
  her through the centuries, convinced they belong together forever.</p> <p>But as
  the twenty-first century begins and her children and grandchildren―consumed with
  immortality in their own ways, from the frontiers of digital currency to genetic
  engineering―develop new technologies that could change her fate and theirs, Rachel
  knows she must find a way out.</p> <p>Gripping, hilarious, and profoundly moving,
  Eternal Life celebrates the bonds between generations, the power of faith, the purpose
  of death, and the reasons for being alive.</p> '
