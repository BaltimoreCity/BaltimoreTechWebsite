description: '<p>Navigators Meetings will be held twice monthly on the first and third
  Sundays of the month. The meetings will be held at 3:00 at Baltimore Ethical Society,
  our sponsoring agency, and will last approximately 1.5-2 hours.<br/>During spring
  and summer months, the second meeting of the month will usually be held out in the
  community at various times according to the activity. Some months we will provide
  an optional third “flex” meeting that may be a social get together or in interesting
  community activity.</p> <p>This is a family scouting group and the expectation is
  that parents/guardians attend the meetings with their children.</p> <p>Yearly dues
  for our shortened year will be $40 per family, which includes one T shirt. BES members
  receive a discount as being part of our sponsoring agency and their dues are $30.
  Additional uniform shirts cost $13.50. There will be an additional fee per child
  if we purchase patches. All activities will be paid by the family, although we will
  strive for free or cheaper activities. Monies will be handled through PayPal. No
  refunds</p> '
