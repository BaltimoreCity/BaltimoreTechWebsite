description: '<p>Our next formal CharmBUG meetup will be held at Onyx Point in Hanover,
  MD. The goal for this meetup will be to discuss any BUG topics, or general issues,
  followed by a Radio Hackathon working with all things "RF" on BSD.</p> <p>We encourage
  anyone interested in RF, Wireless hacking, Software Defined Radio (SDR), or Ham
  Radio to come and hang out as we have a casual discussion on the current state of
  RF/HAM tools on the BSD operating systems. We welcome other discussions on the various
  radio hacking tools available on other operating systems.</p> <p>Information from
  Onyx Point:</p> <p>Our office building may require assistance for wheelchair accessibility.
  Please use the telephone number on the door if you have access issues or have arrived
  late. Restrooms and on-site parking are available.</p> <p>Thanks go out to Onyx
  Point for allowing us to host our CharmBUG meetup in their office space.</p> '
how_to_find_us: We will be in their conference room.
