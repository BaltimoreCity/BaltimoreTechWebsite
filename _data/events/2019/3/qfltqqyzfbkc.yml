description: '<p>The story of how a small team of growth hackers incrementally adopted
  Phoenix/Elixir to scale and improve user experience</p> <p>Legends of Learning had
  a bold plan: to spin up a marketplace of educational mini games with a full middle
  school science curriculum. We built a platform connecting game devs, content reviewers,
  teachers, students, and more, using a simple stack: SQL&lt;=&gt;graphql&lt;=&gt;React.</p>
  <p>In the first version, essentially a prototype that went to prod, we leaned heavily
  on SQL and React, and moved lightning fast... until we didn''t.</p> <p>With customer-facing
  teams tired of technical excuses for bugs or delays, we knew we needed to bend the
  down-turning curve of our feature velocity.</p> <p>We''ve adopted Elixir and over
  the past year, and it has given us a Swiss army knife to incrementally improve,
  upgrade and replace the appâ€™s features.</p> <p>We''re not done yet, but we have
  more tests, fewer fires, and in Elixir / Phoenix, a stack that keeps on delivering
  with concepts that are simple and composable.</p> <p>In this talk I''ll discuss
  some tactics we''ve to execute this transformation, such as feature flagging, how
  (easily) devs have taken to Elixir, and also how we''ve automated deployments with
  Gigalixir. Happy to do lots of time for questions if people are interested in a
  particular area.</p> <p>=============================</p> <p>We are dedicated to
  providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone. Please see our Code
