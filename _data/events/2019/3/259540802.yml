description: '<p>***PLEASE READ ALL NOTES BELOW PRIOR TO RSVPing*** Helping Up Mission
  opened in 1885 and is one of Baltimore’s oldest and largest non-profit organizations.
  The mission offers an array of services to help homeless men get back to living
  responsible, productive lives. You can learn more about the facility here: <a href="https://community.helpingupmission.org/home"
  class="linkified">https://community.helpingupmission.org/home</a> ` Whether you
  have volunteered in the past, or you are brand new to volunteering, I’d love to
  have you join me. This is a great opportunity to get involved and give back. There
  is ample on street parking in front of the mission. Volunteers must be at least
  14 years old and are required to wear closed toe shoes ***NEW*** Notes About Messaging
  and the Waitlist- If you do not have this feature activated, you may miss important
  messages about confirmations, cancellations, and/or other critical information.
  I give Waitlist preference to members who allow direct messages. If you join the
  Waitlist, please make sure have this feature turned on. NO SHOWS AND GUESTS- If
  you accumulate a total of two or more no shows/day of event cancellations for Meal
  Service at Helping Up, you should send me a message PRIOR to RSVPing. This includes
  past Helping Up events. If any slots are available after RSVPs are updated (typically
  a day before the event), I will reply to let you know if there is an available space
  for you. If you do not receive a reply from me stating that it is OK to do so, you
  should not RSVP. If you attempt to RSVP, you will notice that it does not allow
  you to add guests. This is not an error or a glitch within the site, it is intentionally
  set up that way. RSVPs for this event are limited to group members and are not open
  to guests at this time.</p> '
