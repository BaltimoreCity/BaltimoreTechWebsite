description: '<p>Before The Show:</p> <p>Come to Maiwand Grill before the show. We
  can hang out and get something to eat here starting at 6:00. It''s just a block
  away on the corner of Eutaw and Baltimore street.</p> <p>Tickets:</p> <p>This is
  a Pay What You Can preview performance the tickets are available starting at 5:00
  at the theater Box Office. There is no assigned seating and they usually don''t
  run out but don''t wait until the last moment in case they do.</p> <p>Overview:</p>
  <p>Like any culinary trend, relationships are destined to evolve over time—but can
  the recipe of friendship retain its zest if the key ingredients begin to change?
  A fabulous dinner at the home of food writers Gabe and Karen proves hard to swallow
  when Beth drops the bomb that husband Tom wants out of their 12-year marriage. Suddenly,
  both couples find themselves grappling with questions of loyalty, individuality,
  and commitment in Donald Margulies’ deliciously funny, sharply observed Pulitzer
  Prize-winning drama—celebrating its 20th anniversary this season with the time-tested
  flavor and richness of a classic dish.</p> '
