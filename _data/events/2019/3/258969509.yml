description: '<p>Join us for a special tour of the Willard Hackerman collection of
  Maryland maps at the George Peabody Library. Learn about the collection, William
  Hackerman, GIS at Hopkins, and other Sheridan Libraries resources from curators
  Jim Gillispie and Paul Espinosa.</p> <p>From colonial impressions of the Chesapeake
  Bay to detailed city plans for guiding Baltimore''s rapid expansion, this exhibition
  features over thirty of the most stunning and historically significant maps of Maryland
  from the collection of the late businessman, philanthropist, and Johns Hopkins alumnus
  Willard Hackerman. The maps are brought together with related rare books and prints,
  ephemera, and digital story maps to reveal the passion of a collector, the early
  mapping of Maryland, and the potential of combining historical maps with modern
  data to re-examine the past. Highlights include John Ogilby''s "Lord Baltimore Map"
  from 1671, a hand-colored edition of Thomas H. Poppleton''s 1822 "Plan of the City
  of Baltimore," and engraved views of Baltimore from the Harry N. Baetjer Collection
  of Historical Maps and Prints.</p> <p>More information can be found at <a href="https://www.library.jhu.edu/about/exhibitions/"
