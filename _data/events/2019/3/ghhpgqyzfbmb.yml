description: '<p>Well, the Mussel Bar is closed for year because of construction across
  the street from the restaurant. We will be meeting at the Gordon Biersch Brewing
  Company on Lancaster Street right nearby. They a private room that they will let
  us use. (If the private room is busy we will be in the bar.)</p> <p>They have pretty
  good food and a selection of beers made in house. I think we will be happy there
  while we wait for the Mussel Bar to reopen. See you at the Gordon Biersch Brewing
  Company!</p> <p>There are two parking garages where you can park for $4.00 all day
  on Saturday. One is on Fleet Street and the other is on Exeter Street in Little
  Italy. Both are a short walk to the Gordon Biersch Brewing Company.</p> '
