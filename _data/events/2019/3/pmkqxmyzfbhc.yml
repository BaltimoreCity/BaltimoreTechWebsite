description: '<p>We''d love to have you join our Meetup running group. We start a
  little later than most other running groups to accommodate professionals and commuters
  (and people who want to run at 6:45 with the most fun running group ever)!</p> <p>There
  are options to run between 3 and 6 miles at a pace that is comfortable to you.</p>
  <p>If there is interest, we may grab a beer at a dive bar that will let in a group
  of sweaty runners.</p> <p>It seems many of our runners are new to town, so if "B''more"
  and "Hon" are new to you, join us.</p> <p>Oh btw, we call ourselves the Baltimore
  RAT Runners because we like to run Roads And Trails, not because we are running
  from Baltimore''s well-known rat population.</p> <p>Here are some of our runs:<br/>Patterson

  <p>Dan</p> <p>P.S. If you drive and find parking difficult, try the 1200 block of
  Bank Street for free street parking.  Also, the Little Italy Garage is inexpensive
  and safe.  It''s between Central, Exeter, and Bank streets.</p> <p>P.P.S. Although
  MAC management is kind enough to let us meet in their lobby, we are not officially
  affiliated with the MAC and they take no responsibility for Meetup runners.</p> '
