description: '<p>I am very excited about the Amazon and Sogeti event on March 27th
  right here in Baltimore at the American Visionary Art Museum. Experts from AWS and
  Sogeti will be available for discussions and networking.<br/>Great topics:<br/>•
  Exploring new AWS services and their uses<br/>• A case study detailing the use of
  serverless, cloud-native architecture. This session will discuss how the client
  was able to meet extremely high data processing demands without maintaining any
  long-running servers<br/>• Plus several expert tables setup to be able to answer
  specific questions such as trends, migrations, certifications and licensing</p>
