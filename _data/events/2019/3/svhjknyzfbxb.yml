description: '<p>Our rehearsals provide weekly singing lessons on how to sing with
  all the beauty of your voice!  Our performances give everyone a chance to share
  the joy of music with others.</p> <p><b>What happens when I visit?</b></p> <p>At
  your first rehearsal, you will be greeted by a member of the membership committee.
  You have the choice to either watch us or sing on the risers with us. If you want
  to sing, a member our music team will take you aside and listen to your voice. She
  will then assign you to one of the 4 vocal parts that characterize barbershop music
  — tenor, lead, baritone, or bass. In general, tenors sing the highest harmony notes,
  leads sing the melody, basses sing the lowest notes, and baritones harmonize by
  singing the remaining notes in the barbershop chord.</p> <p><b>Can I just observe?</b></p>
  <p>Absolutely! Guests – both men and women – are always welcome to visit and watch
  our rehearsals. We often have people who come just to enjoy the singing.</p> <p><b>Is
  there an age limit?</b></p> <p>We welcome all qualified women to join Pride of Baltimore.
  Our members range in age from the late teens up to 80''s. We do require that women
  under 18 years old be accompanied at all times by an responsible adult such as a
  mother, aunt or other relative. This includes rehearsals, chorus retreats, performances,
  and competitions. Also, please be aware that our rehearsals are physically strenuous.
  We typically stand for 3 hours on the risers and many of our fast-paced songs (aka
  up-tunes) have choreography.</p> <p><b>We audition year round</b></p> <p>We hold
  auditions for the chorus year round and are always looking for singers! To find
  out what it is like to sing with us, we encourage you to visit the chorus several
  times and sing with us on the risers before making the decision to audition. Once
  you have decided to audition, we will be happy to get you started with the process.</p> '
