description: '<p>Biases inherent in data can cause the behavior of machine learning
  algorithms to discriminate against certain populations. Machine learning algorithms
  are used every day by judges and other decision-makers in the criminal justice system
  to decide bail requirements, criminal sentencing, and parole recommendations. James
  Foulds, Assistant Professor of Information Systems at UMBC, has developed an approach
  to demonstrating the bias in current systems and presents a path forward to more
  equitable tools through application of his concept of “differential fairness.” Sonia
  Kumar, Senior Staff Attorney at the ACLU of Maryland, represents clients throughout
  the region who are challenged with confronting unjust outcomes based on the perceived
  “objectiveness” of predictive software. Please come out to participate with James
  and Sonia in a discussion about the legal and technical challenges of machine learning
  algorithms and potential solutions to what is a fundamental issue for the future
  of the criminal justice system.</p> '
