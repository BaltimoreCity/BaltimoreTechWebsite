description: '<p>At some point, you’ve probably admired mineral crystals. Their beautiful
  shapes and colors have fascinated human beings for centuries. But did you realize
  that the smaller a crystal is, the more perfect it usually is? That’s where the
  allure of microminerals comes into play.</p> <p>In this month’s free Nature Connections
  we will be taking an in-depth look at microminerals. Dr. Alan Pribula, curator of
  the NHSM mineral collection and President of the Baltimore Mineral Society, will
  be leading a discussion about and workshop on micromounts. We will lean how micromounts
  are prepared and studied. Microscopes will be available for your use to examine
  and study a variety of micromineral samples. You’ll be able to see first-hand just
  how beautiful these tiny specimens can be. You’ll also have the opportunity to prepare
  one of your own mounts, and will receive a mounted specimen from the NHSM collection.</p>
  <p>Join us for a fascinating look at the beauty and wonder present in these tiny
  specimens!</p> <p>Nature Connections are free and made possible by our amazing volunteers
  and sponsors.</p> <p>***<br/>Note: "Member" refers to being a member of the Natural
