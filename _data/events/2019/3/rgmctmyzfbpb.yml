  /></p> <p>The Teavolve Open Mic happens <b>every Monday evening</b> with host rob
  of the band ilyAIMY. <b>The list goes out at around 6pm-ish and performances kick
  off at 7 running till 10pm.</b> Slots are 2 songs / 10 minutes whichever is shortest
  with a "PG-13" environment. Though there''s technically space for 4 - 5 piece bands,
  we can NOT accommodate a drum-kit; and electric instruments must run through the
  PA (effects are welcome, amps are not). House percussion and piano are generally
  available.</p> <p>Teavolve itself is one of the cooler places you''ll get to either
  play or see Live entertainment with a full menu of deliciousness and that rare and
  wondrous thing: white tea sangria. The night is free; but we encourage you to support
  the venue, and please bring a couple of bucks for the featured artist (paid pass-the-hat
  style).</p> <p>If you have questions, contact the host at <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a>.</p>
  <p>The night is recorded and broadcast Live at <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/robsopenmics">www.ustream.tv/channel/robsopenmics</a>.</p> '
