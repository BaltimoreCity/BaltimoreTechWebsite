description: '<p>Navigators Meetings will be held twice monthly on the second and
  fourth Sundays of the month. The first meeting of the month will be held at 3:00
  at Baltimore Ethical Society, our sponsoring agency, and will last approximately
  1.5-2 hours. The second meeting of the month will be held out in the community at
  various times according to the activity. Some months we will provide an optional
  third “flex” meeting that may be a social get together or in interesting community
  activity.</p> <p>This is a family scouting group and the expectation is that parents/guardians
  attend the meetings with their children.</p> <p>Yearly dues for our shortened year
  will be $40 per family, which includes one shirt. BES members receive a discount
  as being part of our sponsoring agency and their dues are $30. Additional uniform
  shirts cost $13.50. There will be an additional fee per child if we purchase patches.
  All activities will be paid by the family, although we will strive for free or cheaper
  activities. Monies will be handled through PayPal. No refunds.</p> '
