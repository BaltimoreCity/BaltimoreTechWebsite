  /> Learn to identify plants in an informal setting with other inquisitive people
  and a botanist who can answer your questions. Bring a plant or twig from your own
  backyard. Or look at one from an ongoing inventory of the Baltimore County Ag Center.
  All experience levels are welcome. Weâ€™ll have botany books, hand lenses, dried plant
  specimens, and a microscope available for you to use.</p> <p>Cost: $10 - Register
  and pay online at www.marylandnature.org/events.</p> <p>Leaders: The sessions will
  be facilitated by Charlie Davis and Judy Fulton. Charlie is a professional field
  ecologist who specializes in plants. Judy is a Master Gardener who is conducting
  a plant inventory at the Baltimore County Center for MD Agricultural and Farm Park.
  Both Charlie and Judy are volunteers, so your money for these sessions will go directly
  to support the programs, the nature collections, and the building that make this
  kind of nature education possible.</p> <p>Photo credit: Judy Fulton - Cardinal Flower
