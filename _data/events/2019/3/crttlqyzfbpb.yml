description: '<p>First timer? Read the FAQ below! (Thanks to the Columbia/Howard County
  Social/Games for this FAQ)</p> <p>Q: Is this event free? A: Overall, yes, until
  you get addicted and start buying games too! There is an expectation to at least
  buy a drink from the Cantina. They work hard to keep up with us and we want to support
  them as well. Buying food is better, but a drink would be expected. If you cannot
  afford a drink one week, try for another week.</p> <p>Q: Where is everyone? A: Gaming
  usually happens to the left of the main door on top of the platform. Sometimes,
  we get moved around a little bit and may be in the booths.</p> <p>Q: What time is
  the event? A: 6 pm to however late people stick around. The bar is open until 1,
  and the grill/sushi closes at 10. It really depends on what game is getting played
  vs. people’s own schedules. Most people stick around until 8:30/9.</p> <p>Q: How
  do I start playing a game? A: We all just kind of figure it out as we go. At the
  beginning of the evening (or when a game finishes) we generally just try and take
  stock of how many people are looking to start a game and figure out what make the
  most sense with style of game and interest. If you''re new or are looking for a
  particular type of game to play, mention it so we can find the best fit for the
  most people. Most people who own the games are happy to teach them, and that is
  what happens most of the time.</p> <p>Q: What kind of games do you play? A: All
  kinds! The board gaming hobby has exploded in the past 20+ years to tens of thousands
  of games. If you''re not already familiar, it can be a bit overwhelming. Because
  we''re constantly trying out new games, it''s common that it''s a first time for
  most of the players. An explanation of the rules is a standard part of the experience,
  so just come ready to learn and have fun. Our group tends to heavily play “Euros”.
  We will play other board game types, but be aware that older board games, such as
  Monopoly, Sorry or traditional older board games generally are not played. You are
  always welcome to bring what you’d like to play and hope for takers.</p> <p>Q: Can
  I show up late? A: Yes, but keep in mind that there may be no free players right
  when you do. You''ll probably have to wait a while for a game to break up so you
  can join in. Please let people know that you want to play so we can accommodate
  you and fit you in. We generally start playing after 6.</p> <p>Q: Can I eat while
  I play? A: Often yes, but always ask the owner of the game. Games are mostly paper,
  after all, and no one wants greasy finger foods turning their game into a very expensive
  napkin. Most of us get there earlier at 5:30 to eat and then play. The tables are
  not very big, so you may have to put your food off to the side while playing.</p>
  <p>Q: Do I have to bring a game? A: No</p> <p>Q: But *can* I bring a game? A: Absolutely!
  Every game at this event is brought by attendees. Just be sure you''re familiar
  enough with the rules to teach new players.</p> <p>Q: Can I just watch? A: Yes.
  It''s pretty common, especially when people are waiting for more players. Just ask
  the table and make sure any friendly chatting doesn''t disrupt the flow of the game.</p>
  <p>Q: What if I didn''t RSVP? A: No one is going to pester you about it if you forget
  or just make a last minute decision to join in ... BUT a high RSVP count lets other
  meetup folk know that the group is healthy and active. It also helps with emergency
  situations where we may need to move our location last minute and we can let you
  know so you don’t end up going to the wrong place.</p> '
