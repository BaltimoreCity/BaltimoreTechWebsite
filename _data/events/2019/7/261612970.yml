  Bio<br/>Stephanie and Tim have a combined eighteen years of experience in digital
  marketing. After meeting on the job at an ad agency, they discovered that many nonprofits
  did not know they qualified for Google Ad Grants accounts. As a result nonprofit
  were missing out on free funding for digital advertising and even paying for ads
  when they didn't need to. Together, they started Good Intents to help nonprofits
  connect with their grants and to provide specialized management for Google Ad Grants
  accounts.</p> "
