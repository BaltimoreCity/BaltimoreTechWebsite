  <p>No prior coding experience required, come with an open-mind and willingness to
  learn.</p> <p>Instructors:<br/>@Doug<br/>@Aaron Brooks<br/>@Ryan White</p> <p>This
  wee''s meetup will be combined with our regular Project night.</p> <p>On project
  nights we’ll dive head first into the projects with which we’re directly involved
  &amp;/or most interested. If you’re still brand new to coding &amp; project development
  and unsure how to directly contribute to an active project, that’s perfectly fine.
  Participate as an observer and take notes; by doing so you will only learn &amp;
  grow! Project leads &amp; more seasoned developers in our group are encouraged to
  help our beginners learn, feel engaged and get their toes wet in whatever aspects
  of projects they feel most comfortable. More than one project workshops may be going
  on at once during these nights and ideas for new projects are always welcome. Some
  of our projects in the works and those already suggested are not limited to but
  also include:</p> <p>• Web design &amp; Front-end development<br/>• Chatbots<br/>•
  Raspberry Pi configuration<br/>• Arduino configuration<br/>• Google APIs in practice<br/>•
  Hardware &amp; Robotics</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Brains + Computer</p> <p>• Important

how_to_find_us: Please note that there is NO FREE PARKING at the lot adjacent to Impact
  Hub (10 E North Avenue). Attendees are advised to use nearby street parking, and
  NOT the lot next to IH as this has caused some visitors to have their cars impounded
  in the past.
