  is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community.
  However, we ask that cis men come as guests of women and gender minorities to our
  events to promote a sense support and encouragement for women and gender minorities
  in the R community. Please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies. Please
