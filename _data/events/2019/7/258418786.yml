description: '<p>Welcome to Project night! On project nights we’ll dive head-first
  into the projects with which we’re directly involved &amp;/or most interested. If
  you’re still brand new to coding &amp; project development and unsure how to directly
  contribute to an active project, that’s perfectly fine. Participate as an observer
  and take notes; by doing so you will only learn &amp; grow! Project leads &amp;
  more seasoned developers in our group are encouraged to help our beginners learn,
  feel engaged and get their toes wet in whatever aspects of projects they feel most
  comfortable. More than one project workshops may be going on at once during these
  nights and ideas for new projects are always welcome. Some of our projects in the
  works and those already suggested are not limited to but also include:</p> <p>•
  Web design &amp; Front-end development<br/>• Chatbots<br/>• Raspberry Pi configuration<br/>•
  Arduino configuration<br/>• Google APIs in practice<br/>• Hardware &amp; Robotics</p>
  <p>• What to bring<br/>Brains + Computer</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>If it''s
  your first time attending, please go through this on-boarding document to get all
  the necessary tools set up: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JujPe0QZ8ag9k75vNo1eAEZqVrf3yFPAWMcMHWfmlak/edit?usp=sharing"

how_to_find_us: Please note that there is NO FREE PARKING at the lot adjacent to Impact
  Hub (10 E North Avenue). Attendees are advised to use nearby street parking, and
  NOT the lot next to IH as this has caused some visitors to have their cars impounded
  in the past.
