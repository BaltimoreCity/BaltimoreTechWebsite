  Support to Operations<br/>In this talk, LTC John J. Agnello will discuss how data
  analytics and data science principles support Cyberspace Operations, by providing
  Combat Support Effort, akin to the relationship between close air support and ground
  maneuver operations. John will highlight how this approach synchronizes with other
  efforts in prescribing how we fight, organize, train and equip across the DOTMLPF-P
  (Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities and
  Policy). These concepts derive from proven scientific principles, data science,
  joint doctrine, NIST standards, and operational experience.</p> <p>Speakers<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Lieutenant
