  <p>Scheduled Talk(s):</p> <p>â€¢ Vim Startup (Beginner) - Stephen Belcher, 15 Minutes</p>
  <p>If you''ve never played with Vim''s startup flags, I don''t blame you; the coolest
  stuff happens after you''re inside Vim. But, there are some interesting ways Vim
  can be interacted with from the command line, and I''ll explore a few of those in
  this talk.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Scheduled Beer: Peabody Heights "Professor Trash
  Wheel Blinded Me Wit Science", a 4.9% Witbier</p> '
