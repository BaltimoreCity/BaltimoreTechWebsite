description: '<p>Motion is an integral part of our everyday interactions with the
  world. It is also increasingly becoming a meaningful way to convey information through
  the technology, systems, and services we all use. What are the principles that govern
  our perception of motion, and how do these concepts influence the design of interactions
  for our users? This session will cover a foundational understanding of the history
  of animation, its transition to the web, and the way modern web interactions embrace
  motion as a means to enrich user experience. There will also be a brief demo of
  how developers and designers can work together to craft meaningful motion, and provide
  next steps for those who are interested in exploring this engaging element in modern
  UX.</p> <p>Presenters: Eric Smallwood and Mark Adkins, Bellese Technologies</p>
