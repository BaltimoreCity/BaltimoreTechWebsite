description: '<p>Thank you Daniel for presenting in May! Let''s see what June has

  Perl and Vim (Beginner) - Stephen Belcher, 20 minutes</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Scheduled
  Beer: Union Craft Brewers "Divine", a 6.5% IPA. "The hops are the breakout stars
  in this Divine IPA. Plump, juicy, and oozing with tropical fruity charisma. Citra
  and Mosaic have gotten all dressed up and are ready for their closeup. With an aroma
  that’s big and bold and a body that’s soft and smooth, we’ve crafted this perversely
  hoppy IPA to be as free spirited and full of character as Charm City itself. Reach
  for the stars and grab a taste of the Divine."</p> '
how_to_find_us: As usual, we will be in the office building across the street from
  the main VLP library building, on the second floor. The inside door will be locked,
  but someone will be listening for the knock.
