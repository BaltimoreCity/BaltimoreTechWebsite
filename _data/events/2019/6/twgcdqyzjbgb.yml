description: "<p>Join fellow Go programming enthusiasts, professionals and the just-curious
  for an evening of presentations, learning and socializing.</p> <p>We aim to be a
  welcoming and inclusive group regardless of your skill level, race or gender identity.
  Don't hesitate to come and spend some quality time with us as we explore all that
  Go has to offer.</p> <p>Speakers/Talks</p> <p>While we never run out of impromptu
  Go topics to discuss at our meetings, if you'd like to give a full-length or even
  a lightning talk on something you're working on or find interesting (relevant to
  Go, of course), feel free to reach out and we'll put you on the agenda.</p> <p>Location</p>
  <p>Our meetups are hosted at City Garage, 101 W. Dickman Street, Baltimore, MD 21230.
  There's plenty of free parking and is right off of I-95 (via Exit 54).</p> <p>#golang</p> "
