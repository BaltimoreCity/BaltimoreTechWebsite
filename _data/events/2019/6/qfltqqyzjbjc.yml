description: '<p>We had a great time at our May "Prepare fo Summer" event. For June,
  the idea is to check-in on how any side projects or learning effort are going, and
  get your questions asked.</p> <p>No matter your skill level or experience, this
  event is for you! We had several people, even though with years of experience, sharpening
  basic skills via some fun exercises at our May meetup.</p> <p>Even if you didn''t
  make it to our May meetup, come join in June, and ensure you''re on track to make
  the most of any foul weather that might come our way this summer. We hope to get
  everyone on a great path and see awesome results at our September meetup. Don''t
  miss it!</p> <p>====</p> <p>Prepare for Summer</p> <p>What does that mean? At some
  point this summer the weather will be bad, or it will just be crazy hot and humid
  outside. What will you do to make the best of your time indoors? How about some
  Elixir!</p> <p>Our goals for this event are:<br/>1. Answer any questions someone
  getting started with Elixir might have<br/>2. Ensure everyone has Elixir running
  on their laptop<br/>3. Look at open source projects or learning efforts you can
  undertake this summer<br/>4. Get help on any side projects you might be working
  on<br/>5. Network!</p> <p>====</p> <p>We rely on the community to keep this meetup
  going. Please consider suggesting a topic or activity, or even better, volunteer
  to speak!</p> <p>If you have an idea for a talk you''d like to give, please send
  a message to one of the organizers and we''ll make it happen!</p> <p>====</p> <p>We
  are dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone. Please
  see our Code of Conduct (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Elixir-and-Erlang-Meetup/pages/28313285/Code_of_Conduct/"
