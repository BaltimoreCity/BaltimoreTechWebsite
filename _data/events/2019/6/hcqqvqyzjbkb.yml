description: '<p>Join us this month to talk about data analysis workflows using both
  Python and R with Christine Zhang from The Baltimore Sun! She''ll talk through an
  article/project she worked on where she needed to use both Python and R to help
  parse and understand what the data said.</p> <p>Christine is a Data Journalist with
  The Baltimore Sun where she reports news stories using data analysis and statistics
  (using mostly R and Python). Before joining The Sun in 2018, she worked as a data
  scientist at Two Sigma and was previously an OpenNews fellow at the Los Angeles
  Times and a research analyst at the Brookings Institution. She has a B.A. from Smith
  College and an M.A. from Columbia University.</p> <p>Read more about what she''s

  <p>Meetup Goals</p> <p>The meet up has 3 goals:</p> <p>1. Serve as a foundation
  for the creation of a Python eco-system in City government.</p> <p>2. Encourage
  and empower municipal employees to identify opportunities to ask and answer more
  complex questions and eliminate repetitive, labor or paper-intensive, non-value
  added work.</p> <p>3. Help participants think through and pursue the use of Python
  as a tool to automate key parts of the data analysis, reporting or administrative
  task workflow to help the management decision making process or improve service
  delivery.</p> <p>What to Bring</p> <p>A laptop and some curiosity.</p> <p>Meet Up
  Github repo</p> <p>here (<a href="https://github.com/brl1906/python4CityGovtProcessImprovement"
