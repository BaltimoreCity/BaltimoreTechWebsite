description: '<p>Our June meetup features a presentation Nick Schmidt of BLDS, LLC
  speaking on Fairness in Machine Learning and AI. Doors open at 6 pm. After a half-hour
  of networking and refreshments. Our program starts at 6:30 pm.</p> <p>Nick''s talk:
  There is a growing recognition that AI models have the potential to be biased or
  discriminatory. Due to concerns about social justice, fear of perpetuating bias,
  and the need to meet legal anti-discrimination requirements, it is essential that
  the AI community address this issue and ensure that the models they put into production
  treat people fairly. Nick will discuss ideas of fairness and how they apply to machine
  learning. He will explore recent academic work on identifying and mitigating bias,
  as well as discuss how his work in lending and employment can be applied to other
  industries. Nick will explain how to measure whether an algorithm is fair and also
  demonstrate the techniques that model builders can use to ameliorate bias when it
  is found.</p> <p>Nicholas Schmidt is a Partner and the A.I. Practice Leader at BLDS,
  LLC (<a href="https://www.bldsllc.com/schmidt" class="linkified">https://www.bldsllc.com/schmidt</a>).
  He specializes in the application of statistics and economics to questions of law,
  regulatory compliance, and best practices in model governance.</p> '
