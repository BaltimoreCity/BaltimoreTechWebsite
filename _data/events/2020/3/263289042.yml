  men welcome to attend R-Ladies events?<br/>A: Yes, men are welcome at this event.
  Our mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved
  in the R community. However, we ask that cis men come as guests of women and gender
  minorities to our events to promote a sense support and encouragement for women
  and gender minorities in the R community. Please help us by spreading the word about
  R-Ladies. Please also take the time to review our code of conduct before you attend:
  <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct</a></p>
  <p>The term \"women and gender minorities\" is inclusive of individuals who identify
  as female (trans and cis), trans-men, non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,
  intersex, and all minority genders).</p> <p>Important to know:<br/>- If this is
  your first R-Ladies event, please take a moment to review our R-Ladies Global code
