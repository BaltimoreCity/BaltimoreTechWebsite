description: '<p>Join us to hear from a group of students in University of Baltimore’s
  Applied Information Technology program who used python and other programming languages
  in a series of projects throughout the year. They’ll talk through and demonstrate
  a python-based prototype for an indoor farming infrastructure dedicated to educational
  and research purposes, and<br/>an augmented reality system aimed at helping astronauts
  in carrying out tasks while on space walks.</p> <p>See more about their NASA-related
  augmented reality program here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek76dkvbwVI"
  class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek76dkvbwVI</a></p> <p>Each python
  meet up will: 1) start with a short flash talk demoing an idea, project, library
  of useful feature or function—the ‘talks’ section, 2) allow opportunities for folks
  to work individually on a short program around a Python use case like data analysis
  or automation of a task—the ‘development’ section.</p> <p>Goals</p> <p>The meet
  up has 3 goals:</p> <p>1. Serve as a foundation for the creation of a Python eco-system
  in City government.</p> <p>2. Encourage and empower municipal employees to identify
  opportunities to ask and answer more complex questions and eliminate repetitive,
  labor or paper-intensive, non-value added work.</p> <p>3. Help participants think
  through and pursue the use of Python as a tool to automate key parts of the data
  analysis, reporting or administrative task workflow to help the management decision
  making process or improve service delivery.</p> <p>What to Bring</p> <p>A laptop
  and some curiosity.</p> <p>Meet Up Github repo</p> <p>here (<a href="https://github.com/brl1906/python4CityGovtProcessImprovement"
  class="linkified">https://github.com/brl1906/python4CityGovtProcessImprovement</a>)</p> '
