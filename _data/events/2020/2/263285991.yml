description: '<p>R-Ladies Baltimore (Bmore) is the local Baltimore chapter for the
  larger R-Ladies global organization (rladies.org) to promote gender diversity in
  the R community.</p> <p>We''ve decided to change things up a bit and meet for a
  longer time to work on hacking away on a dataset! We want this to be productive
  for each of you, so you are encouraged to bring your own dataset / project to make
  progress on your own analysis. We''ll be in the room 9am-4pm and you are welcome
  to attend all of it or a portion of it. If you are running into problems with your
  code, we can help debug!</p> <p>We will aim for lunch to be served.</p> <p>Details
  on the location:<br/>615 N. Wolfe St.<br/>Baltimore, MD 21205<br/>Room W3008</p>
  <p>FAQ:<br/>Q: Are men welcome to attend R-Ladies events?<br/>A: Yes, men are welcome
  at this event. Our mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals
  to get involved in the R community. However, we ask that cis men come as guests
  of women and gender minorities to our events to promote a sense support and encouragement
  for women and gender minorities in the R community. Please help us by spreading
  the word about R-Ladies. Please also take the time to review our code of conduct
  before you attend: <a href="https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct"
  class="linkified">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct</a></p>
  <p>The term "women and gender minorities" is inclusive of individuals who identify
  as female (trans and cis), trans-men, non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,
  intersex, and all minority genders).</p> <p>Important to know:<br/>- If this is
  your first R-Ladies event, please take a moment to review our R-Ladies Global code
