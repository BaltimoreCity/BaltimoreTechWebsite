general info:
  bio: Iâ€™m a designer raised in an era of Lisa Frank, Gecko Hawaii and now find myself
    cringing at what I fear is their impending return. Most recently, I was the creative
    director at the Sunlight Foundation. I am currently available for small freelance
    projects as I pursue my MA in Social Design at MICA
