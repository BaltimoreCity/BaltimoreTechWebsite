general info:
  bio: I am a refugee from the legal profession. Software engineering has always appealed
    to me both as a thing in and of itself and also as a way to change society for
    the better. I went into law because that\'s where my most immediate and obvious
    strengths were but I didn\'t enjoy the profession.
