general info:
  bio: I\'m originally from the Bay Area, CA and graduated from UC Berkeley with a
    degree in Integrative Biology. After college I decided that I wanted to pursue
    an entirely different career in technology and still incorporate my passion for
    advocating for under-served communities in higher education.
