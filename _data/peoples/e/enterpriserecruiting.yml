    normal\">Enterprise’s mission is to create opportunity for low- and moderate-income
    people through affordable housing in diverse, thriving communities. We are driven
    by our mission, fueled by business discipline and sustained by donors and investors.
    Since 1982, Enterprise has worked with partners in communities nationwide. One
    of America’s original social enterprises, we bring together the people and resources
    to create affordable housing in strong neighborhoods. Within Enterprise are entities
    that lend funds, finance development and manage and build affordable housing.
    To date, Enterprise has invested $18.6 billion, helped create nearly 340,000 homes and
    touched millions of lives. In fact, every day someone moves into a better place
    to live thanks to Enterprise.</span>'
