general info:
  name: Eili Klein
  location: Baltimore
  bio: I have worked with information technology for more than 20 years, first as
    front-end developer and then as an e-architect and project manager. I am experienced
    in several programming languages (C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript,
    SQL, ColdFusion, Cobol, ASP), frameworks (Jquery, Bootstrap), and systems (AWS,
    Azure, Apps, Stripe, Cloudflare) and have experience building large-scale applications
    for large and small companies. I am currently an <a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/9514751/eili-klein\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University</a> and a <a
    href=\"http://cddep.org/profile/eili_klein\" rel=\"nofollow\">fellow at the Center
    for Disease Dynamics, Economics &amp; Policy</a>, with a PhD in mathematical ecology.
    Recent projects include the development of <a href=\"https://resistancemap.cddep.org/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">ResistanceMap</a>, a repository for antibiotic resistance data
    from around the world, and <a href=\"https://surveillance.cddep.org/index.php\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">ResistanceMap Surveillance Network</a>, which interfaces with
    hospital electronic medical record systems and collects patient-level antimicrobial
    resistance data and provides a portal for hospitals to query data and generate
    antibiograms. I do not believe there is a single correct technology, but that
    individuals and companies must continually update, modify, and adapt to the a
    changing technological world. I have the ability and experience to develop new
    ground-breaking apps as well as the ability to tie them back to legacy mainframe
    systems when necessary. I am experienced both in developing technology as well
    as selling technology, and can provide experience in managing projects large and
    small.
