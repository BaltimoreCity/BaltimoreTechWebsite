general info:
  bio: Over that last 10 years, I\'ve developed the ability to work with business
    leaders, users, and other stakeholders to develop a vision for a software product.  After
    eliciting requirements from stakeholders, I can take a broad vision and develop
    that vision into something more concrete.
