general info:
  bio: I\'m inspired by the Great Books methodology of shared inquiry; the social
    constructionist underpinnings of Moodle; the just-in-time learning of Outward
    Bound/NOLS wilderness education; and writing workshop/art studio conversations
    between makers.  I\'m a former teacher who loves thinking companies.
