general info:
  bio: I\'m a full-stack hacker and a graphic designer. I\'ve written just about every
    language there is, but I prefer to do my work in Node.js because it\'s just plain
    amazing and allows me finish insane amounts of work in no time. I\'m always looking
    for something to get in to.
