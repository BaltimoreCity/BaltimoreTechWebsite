general info:
  bio: My goal, with each project I take on, is to create systems and conditions that
    inspire creative confidence in others and their communities. Science-fiction and
    philosophy are the sources for my intellectual kicks. I enjoy surfing and watching
    the stars while camping, when I get the time.
