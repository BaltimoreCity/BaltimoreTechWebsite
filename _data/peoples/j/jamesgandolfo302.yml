general info:
  bio: Software sales has been my life for the past 2.5 years.  I have applied my
    interest in problem solving that I have learned through my lifelong hobbies of
    troubleshooting motors and surfboards to my current efforts in sales.  I am a
    lifelong student and excited to meet new people.
