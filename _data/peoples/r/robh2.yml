general info:
  bio: I have a degree in Industrial Design and am a 3D animator, illustrator and
    designer. I\'ve been an advertising commercial photographer in the past. I own
    and run a 3D printer and am a moderator on a popular 3D printing web forum. If
    not doing the above, you\'ll find me on my boat on the Patapsco.
