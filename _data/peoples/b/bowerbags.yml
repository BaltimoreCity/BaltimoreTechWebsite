general info:
  bio: My passion is finding new approaches to problem solving and my mission for
    the past 4 years has been to reinvent how we carry things. I was named one of
    20 people to watch under 35 by Brazen Careerist. I started sewing configurable
    bags on my kitchen table, sold my first 100 and never looked back.
